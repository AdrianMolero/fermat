# Welcome to Fermat!

In the last 20 years virtually everything went digital: pictures, music, videos, mails, etc. Nevertheless we still have cash as paper money. Why isn't cash money digital yet?

The reason is that digital information can be cloned, and if digital cash could be cloned it would render it useless. When bitcoin was invented it brought with it the solution to the last barrier preventing money to be digital: the solution to the double spend problem.

We firmly believe that the next decade will witness governments issuing digital currency based on blockchain technology. We expect paper money is going to disappear within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for digital wallets will inevitably emerge.

In order to meet this demand thousands of wallets, different in terms of not only the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing govermet issued digital money others crypto currencies, and others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their look and feel and their functionalities (wallets will evolve into sophisticated financial applications), should be available. Such a wide variety of wallets is indispensable owing to the diversity characterizing the world's population and its financial needs.

Fermat is a master plan to avoid getting to that future through waiting for independent entrepreneurs to build each of these wallets and financial apps one at the time and from scratch, repeating every time all the math, accounting, cryptography and algorithms that are common to all these apps. Fermat handles all that and by doing the heavy lifting enables any developer in the world to easily create niche wallets on top of its shared infraestructure.

Fermat is a trust-less financial application framework that enables an ecosystem of any kind of trust-less financial applications, including wallets. It features a Peer-to-Peer network for transporting meta-data and inter-connect clients between each other. It also features a synchronization scheme that transforms a standalone app into a distributed application across several devices still owned by the same user.

The framework evolves from the standalone crypto wallet and enables the development of trust-less financial applications that are both crypto-currency and digital-asset-enabled. The Framework handles a full stack of layers. Starting down it has the OS API level, then the Blockchain Level, the Communication Level, Platform Level up to the User Interface Level. Its goal is to allow even non-developers to build their own desktop and mobile trust-less financial applications in a similar way a non-developer builds a Worldpress site: re-using plugins and themes. 

The challange is huge, but we know the difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a team's determination. We have the will to excel and the will to reach our vision for this world. 

We have the talent, the drive, and the determination to enable the next generation of financial applications that will allow people to hold their own digital value by themselves in a secure way and participate with their funds in a multitude of transactions and business oportunities across the globe.

We believe the open source community collectively has more talent than any of us individually. We believe it is important to build on top of services that others took time and effort to build. We believe in decentralization.
 
We are asking each of you to help lead the way.  Because we’re already connected with you as we are also developers and designers, and we want to build our relationship with you into a network of developers across the world to share new ideas and forge new collaborations. Working together, we can build the tools and technology the people need to become financially independent, have access to world wide financial products and be safe of nasty third parties spying on them or trying to tell them what they can and can not do with their money. We believe in financial freedom.

We want to hear from you on how we can build this network. We are arround 30 developers working full time on Fermat by now and our goal is to be 300. To learn more about how to participate, just go to [how-to-participate](https://github.com/bitDubai/participate-now). We hope every single one of you will join us.  Because Fermat needs you.  The world needs you.  We need your skills, your imagination and your optimism.  And with this new network, we know we can be partners for decades to come.

We believe in people with passion who are crazy enough to think they can change the world. With a lot of hard work, we believe we are going to change the world.

We are not going to stop until we do it.

<br>
## The Challenge

While designing Fermat we tried to find the answer to the following questions:

* How can we isolate ordinary people from the perceived complexity of crypto currencies?
* How can we use the collective intelligence of the developer community?
* How can we reuse the entire current infrastructure already in place?
* How do we integrate legacy financial institutions in a way they feel comfortable?
* How do we integrate merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes in a clever way?
* How can we allow people to create digital wallets without programming anything at all?
* How can we keep people's digital money at their hands without needing to trust third parties? 
* How can we create a fair systems with the developers who contributed to it?

The answers to each of these questions are addressed within Fermat.

<br>
## What is Fermat?

Fermat is a system for experimentation on what needs to be done to get crypto currencies mass adopted.

Technically Fermat is an open-source P2P system built on a plug-ins architecture that handles a stack of platforms and runs on multiple OS including Android, Linux, iOS, OSX and Windows.

What makes Fermat different from other wallet systems or services?

* **Fermat is P2P.** This makes it censorship resistent and difficult to be attacked.

* **Fermat is built with plugins.** This enables functionality to be reused and opens the door to any developer to participate.

* **Fermat runs on end users' devices.** This enables users to hold their own money eliminating the need to trust a third party.

* **Fermat is inclusive.** By creating their own plugins, current industry members can integrate with Fermat to offer their services and products to Fermat's user base.

* **Fermat segments the world population and offers a custom tailored solution for each segment.** Any developer can easily create niche wallets for a particular group of people. Brands can create their own wallets for their followers. All the heavy lifting is done by the Fermat underlaying technology.

* **Fermat guaratees plugins and wallet developers a revenue stream.** Fermat implements an innovative business model which allows plugins and wallet developers to define a use license, and Fermat itself enforces this license on behalf of developers.

Fermat is moving towards version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our
[documentation](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/tree/master/fermat-documentation) that we're anxious to add.
So take Fermat out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite platform to launch your own digital wallet.
