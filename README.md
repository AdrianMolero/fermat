bitDubai
========

The objective of the bitDubai project is to develop whatever technology is found to be neccesary to bring adoption of crypto currencies to the entire world population as fast as possible.

To accomplish this a prioritized list of the problems/barriers that are preventing mass adoption has been written and a solution has been proposed for each of these problems with one condition: each solution must fit into the architecture of one single system that would solve all these identified problems at the same time.

As of today, this system spans two interconected platforms: a Crypto Wallet Platform and a Crypto Banking Platform.

The current status of the project is moving towards a non working prototype. The architecture of the system has already been stablished.


# Crypto Wallet Platform

Is a P2P platform with an open architecture that allows highly segmented wallets to be easily created on top of it by any developer, using assets provided by other third parties, which can be rebranded by marketeers and distributed by brands. All that with a licensing system which guarantees to each actor that the use license of their contributions will be enforced by the platform.


# Crypto Banking Platform

Is an extension of the core banking systems banks usually have. It allows traditional banks to create in their own systems "crypto products" adding all the missing parts to make that happen.  


# Project Ownership

While being bootstraped the ownership of the project is of its contributors. The intention is that at a certain point in time the project will become VC-backed and be turn into a company, as this is the fastest way to reach the goal. All contributors will be turned into co-founders and each ones share will be calculated based in the amount of hours contributed to the project by a factor from 1 to 10 assigned to each contributor based on his/her expertise and by consensus with the others.

# Problems & Solutions

The problems listed here are ordered by importance. If you don't agree with the priorization, description of the problem or the solution, or you belive there are other problems not considered here submit a pull request with your suggestions or mail them to contribution@bitdubai.com .

## Problem #1
### People don't want to loose money with volatility

#### Description:

Regular pleople are reluctant to buy and spend bitcoins because they don't want to spend them at loss and neither do they want to keep track of the prices when buying or spending them.

#### Example: 

John Doe bought some bitcoins when the prices were $154, $543, $1243. He also spent some when prices were $355, $731, etc. Owing to this volatility at one point he could not ascertain he was not losing money if he continued spending his bitcoins. He was also discouraged to buy even more at different prices and do the tracking necessary to ensure he would not lose money. In short, he has given up using bitcoin and is waiting for the price to increase so that it is high enough for him to be able to spend the ones he still has without the inconvenience of having to calculate when it is safe to spend. 

#### Solution:

##### Turn the volatility problem into and advantage

* Automate all the management needed  to know when it is safe to spend  bitcoins or any other crypto-currency. This allows regular people to buy and spend bitcoins whenever they need confident that they never lose money. 

* Moreover, each time a user spends within the limits of the available balance calculated by the platform they will profit from the exchange rate. This profit can be interpreted as a discount produced by the wallet technology and serves as a real life incentive to use crypto currency over fiat at any time. 



## Problem #2
### Lack of local ecosystems

#### Descrption:

Bringing bitcoins to a local ecosystem is expensive. You usually pay extra money for bringing them in. 

Then when you spend it at a local shop the payment processor is taking those bitcoins again out of the local ecosystem forcing local users to bring them back from abroad perpetuating the difficulty for regular people of getting coins.

Merchants prefer not to hold bitcoins because of the risk of losing money when cashing them out. 

Merchants are facing exactly the same volatility problem as consumers but amplified as the transactions happen much more often compared to a regular user. Payment processors solve the problem for them at the expense of depriving local ecosystems from crypto currency.

#### Example: 

Budapest is a capital city of an European country. It's not only difficult to find a place where you can buy bitcoins (there is only one BTM) but you have to pay 5-10% more than at international marketplaces. If I go and spend it in one of the few local shops that accept them the payment processor makes them leave the country again. The funny part is that the shop takes my bitcoins at the market price charged on an international market thereby automatically producing me a loss of 5 to 10%. 

#### Solution:

* By automating the management for local merchants necessary for them to know when it is safe to resell the bitcoins collected and solving their volatility problem it provides an alternative to a payment processor. Thus merchants can start holding crypto currency and act as refill points for local users. This enables local economies to keep their crypto currency in there also allowing local users to have access to bitcoins without the need to pay extra fees to buy them from abroad.

* Create within the platform a geo fenced P2P network to allow local users to easily track nearby shops and places where they can spend their coins, refill their wallets or cash out. Through this P2P network shops can advertise their individual products to nearby users. Consumers can buy products, reserve them, review them,  and also communicate with the shop.

##### Associated Concepts:

* Local Shop

* Locate nearby Shops.
* Locate nearby Refill Points.
* Locate nearby Cash Out Points.

##### Proposed Functionality:

* B2C paid advertisments.



## Problem #3
### Lack of wallet segmentation

#### Descrption:

When music went digital cassette tapes disappeared. With the digitalization of image film cameras vanished. The technology that allows the digitalization of money has already been invented, consequently paper money and metal coins are bound to disappear soon. Some countries are already considering issuing their currency using this technology. 

Digitalization of money will inevitably bring about with the entire population using digital wallets. People from all walks of life  have different needs and demands which should be reflected by their wallet. The user interface, the functionality available and the way it is accessed should be adapted in a way that best fits the age, gender, cultural background, level of education, social status, etc. of the given user.

The way a Chinese country man thinks and interprets the operations of a wallet is inherently totally different from the way a person from the UK, Argentina, North Korea, Lebanon, Cuba, Nigeria, etc. does. What an accountant could be interested in doing with and seeing in his wallet is not the same what a psychologist, a lawyer or an engineer would be. 

A kid's wallet can not look the same as his teenage brother's or his father's. It is not difficult to visualize that in the future there will be thousands of highly segmented wallets for every single niche imaginable. 

However, on the other hand the core algorithms and mathematics inside those wallets are universal. 

Currently wallet providers can barely identify the different segments of the potential user population and they target almost exclusively the tech-savvy segment even if in their minds are delivering a user friendly product for everyday people too. 

The problem to be solved is how we can save everybody a few years and instead of evolving from where we are now to that future without replicating the same universal technology again and again for every single segmented wallet. 

#### Solution:

* Separate all universal algorithms and mathematics needed to manage crypto wallets and incorporate all that functionality in the crypto wallet platform. All the segment-specific functionality including the user interface should be outside the platform. In this way anyone can quickly and easily create segmented wallets without the need of replicating the universal rules over and over again.

* Open source each segmented wallet so anyone can use it as a basis for other segments/sub-segments or for an alternative implementation of the same segment.

* Incorporated a licensing system into the platform, which allows third party developers to claim a use license for their wallets and the platform guarantees that users will pay according to this license. Other developers can in turn fork any existing segmented wallet further specializing it, and adding their own license which the platform is going to enforce together with the original authors use licenses automatically.  
* The same licensing rules apply to graphic designers who provide assets packages to be used in wallets within the platform. 

* Any of the wallets available can be taken and re-branded by marketing companies in order to be offered to their own customers as an evolution to current loyalty programs. They or their customers can add more license requirements to whatever license structure the original wallet already had.

* A recognized local brand can take a re-branded wallet and market it to both local end users and local merchants coordinating the supply and demand and using their own financial means to do so.

* Include in the wallet platform a wallet store from where end users can download any of the wallets available.

* Developers, marketeers and brands can publish their wallets in the wallet store. 

##### Associated Concepts:

* Wallet Store
* Wallet Manager
* Wallet Factory
* Segmented Wallet
* Wallet Runtime
* Licensing Subsystem

##### Associated Functionality:

* Run a third party wallet on top of the wallet platform
* Allow end users to download any available wallet on the wallet store



## Problem #4
### Banks not stepping in

#### Descrption:

* Traditional banks can see the disruption coming. They see that crypto networks are a disruptive technology that brings a huge opportunity for those who can take it quickly enough and a great threat to those who can't. They lack the agility to come up with a solution by themselves and their traditional platform providers aren't helping. They need to move/react quickly but at the same time should have the agility to adapt to this rapidly evolving landscape. 

* The only way they see so far is to connect to and rely upon a set of startups in order to be able to run a crypto bank. They understand the risk of dealing with companies that can meltdown overnight or not fully comply with regulations. They also face the fact that converting them into a crypto bank is none of these startups core business. 

* Integrating one by one each of their systems to this new technology seems like a huge and resource intensive project.

* Banks have huge financial power to market crypto products to their current customer base that compromises half of the adult population of the world, but they are not doing it in part because the don't have the technology needed to turn their bank into a crypto bank. 


#### Solution:

* Complement the IT infrastructure traditional banks already have allowing them to reuse most of it seamlessly. Enable banks to create new products like bitcoin accounts for their costumers in whatever core banking system they currently have. Enable customers to freely transfer FROM and TO any of these crypto products and fiat accounts as well, using any of the channels currently available like internet banking, mobile banking, phone banking and ATMs. Allow them to withdraw funds from their crypto accounts (turned into fiat) at any branch of the bank or ATM network oblem #2-c)

* Implement an architecture that absorb the evolution of the underlying technologies in order to help them get quickly on top of it with new products and services for their customers and adapt easily to any future change. Assume there will be multiple public networks for transporting value and design the banking platform to adapt quickly to whatever is needed to use.   

* Enable traditional banks to not depend on third party service providers to run a crypto bank and avoid the risk of startups not complying with regulations or melting down overnight. 

##### Associated Concepts:

* Crypto Banking Platform
* Digital Vault
* Money Stream
* Pocket Money
* Bank Segments Wallet
* Smart Sourcing of Funds.

##### Associated Functionality:

* Crypto products in current core banking systems
* Crypto account system
* Refill engine which monitors banks customers wallet and automatically refill them



## Problem #5
### Almost nobody is marketing crypto currencies

#### Descrption:

Since very recently a few well funded startups start spending in marketing virtual currencies to the general public. Besides that, regular people is subject to the mood of the mainstream media, which in turn its mood tends to attached to bitcoin price performance. The problem to solve is how to make every single business of a certain size all arround the world to spend their own financial resources to market both on consumer and merchants the use of crypto currencies and stop depending both on mainstream media coverage and the few resources startups have.

#### Solution:

* Give every single business arround the world the possibility to rebrand one of the hundreds of segmented wallets in a fast and inexpensive way (basically for free).
* Allow them to easily affiate shops to accept their wallets and handle all the details of the different kinds of deals the branded wallet publisher could do with a shop. Enforce automatically the contract between the wallet publisher and the shop accepting its branded wallet.
* Allow them to keep in touch with their user base by sending them any number of different tokens representing coupons, discounts, etc, or even publicity with some value attached. These tokens with crypto value attached  can be used as intended or traded by users of that kind of wallet at will or traded automatically by the platforms AI agent acting on behalf of each user.

##### Associated Concepts:

* Branded Wallet
* Wallet Publisher
* Wallet AI Agent
