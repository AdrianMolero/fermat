# Fermat Tokens

## Introduction

Fermat Tokens are the native application tokens of the Fermat system. End users need these tokens to pay for licenses of paid Fermat APPs and to pay for bandwidh to the Fermat Network's miners.

An in depth descripcion of Fermat Tokens can be found at the [Fermat White Paper](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/FERMAT-WHITE-PAPER.md).

Currently there is no automated system to issue Fermat Tokens as the Fermat Blockchain has not been released, nevertheless severla tokens had been issued already and here we keep track of them.
