/**
 * A business transaction is an exchange of valuables that effects the financial position of a company, such as
 * exchanging money for goods or services. It is the basic activity that defines the status of being in business.
 * Bookkeeping is the process of making a record of all business transactions over time, placed in categories for tax
 * purposes.
 *
 * Every single instance of an exchange of goods or services for valuable consideration, such as money, is a separate
 * business transaction that is important to record in its entirety. The record of transactions is comprised of
 * documents supporting the exchange and the bookkeeping that places the exchange into categories that an accountant
 * can later summarize for financial reporting. This process serves as the basis for many of the businessâ€™ legal
 * obligations, particularly in regard to taxes.
