 * Among the various types of banking transactions are wire transfers, online bill payments and credit card
 * transactions. Other financial transactions that may occur through a bank include mortgage loans and small business
 * loans. Several different types of banking transactions can take place in person, by telephone or online.
 *
 * Various payment transactions make doing business easier. Among these options is a payment method known as a wire
 * transfer. Essentially, transactions utilizing this method involve the transfer of funds from one party’s banking
 * account to another party’s banking account. These business transactions are a routine way of doing business in some
 * parts of the world and help make international business transactions more effective.
 *
 * Online transactions are also an effective way of handling banking transactions. By establishing a checking account
 * that allows online transactions, account holders are able to schedule bills to be paid automatically each month or
 * are given the option of manually paying bills online from a personal computer. Online banking also allows account
 * holders to monitor funds in an account without having to call or visit a bank in person to obtain transaction
 * records.
