/**
 * Intercompany transactions are any type of business transactions that occur between two or more companies. Those
 * companies may have some type of affiliation, such as being owned by the same parent company while maintaining their
 * own identities, or there may be a buyer/supplier relationship between the two. Activities of this type should not be
 * confused with intracompany transactions that involve the completion of tasks between two or more units that are part
 * of the same operation.
 *
 * One of the more common examples of intercompany transactions is the sale of goods or services by a supplier to a
 * buyer. For example, a company that manufactures lawn furniture may enter into a deal with a retailer to supply
 * tables, lawn chairs, and outdoor chaise lounges to the retailerâ€™s outlets for sale to the general public. Since the
 * deal is structured so that the retailer buys the lawn furniture from the supplier, the transaction involves the need
 * to complete the transaction with the creation of an invoice that is presented after delivery, and with terms of
 * payment that both parties have agreed is reasonable.
