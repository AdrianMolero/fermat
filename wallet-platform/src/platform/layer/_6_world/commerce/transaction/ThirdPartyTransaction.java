/**
 * A third-party transaction is a type of business transaction in which the dealings between the buyer and the seller
 * are managed through an intermediary or third party. This third party may be involved in crafting the particulars of
 * the deal, or serve as the means of receiving a payment from a buyer and forwarding that payment to the seller. The
 * use of a third-party transaction is common in a number of business deals, including mortgage financing and even the
 * remittance of payment for services rendered through some sort of online payment portal.
 *
 * One of the more common examples of a third-party transaction has to do with mortgage brokering. In this scenario,
 * the broker will attempt to match the needs of a potential home buyer with the loan programs offered by a lender. The
 * idea is to create a connection between the buyer and seller that works to the benefit of all parties concerned. In
 * the best of circumstances, the buyer is able to work through the broker to secure a mortgage with rates and terms
 * that are agreeable, while the seller works through the broker to gain a new client. The broker benefits from the
 * successful execution of the deal by receiving some sort of compensation, usually in the form of a commission.
