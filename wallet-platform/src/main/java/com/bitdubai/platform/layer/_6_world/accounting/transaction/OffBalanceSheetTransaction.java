/**
 * Off-balance sheet transactions represent financing that does not appear on the balance sheet of a company because
 * the applicable accounting principles allow for a different treatment in the financial statements. Examples of such
 * off-balance sheet transactions include the acquisition of assets on operating leases or the use of special-purpose
 * vehicles such as partnerships or trusts. Using off-balance sheet transactions might be seen as beneficial to a
 * company because the resulting liabilities are not shown on the balance sheet of the company, so its financial
 * position might appear in a better light to investors or lenders.
 *
 * By using off-balance sheet financing, a company might find it easier to obtain funding through equity capital or
 * loans. When investors study the financial statements of a company, they give close attention to the liquidity of
 * the company, one measure of which is the ratio of debt to equity. A company with high levels of debt compared to its
 * equity capital might be seen as a relatively risky investment. Also, a high level of debt might make it more
 * difficult for the company to obtain further loans. If some of the debt can be excluded from the balance sheet, the
 * financial position of the company might appear in a better light, and this will improve the company's borrowing
 * capacity.
