/**
 *  In accounting, the events that affect the finances of a business and must be recorded on the books.
 *  Transactions are recorded in what are known as "journal entries." Each entry describes a single
 *  transaction and states its date and amount.
 *
 *  An accounting transaction will be recorded differently if the company uses accrual accounting rather
 *  than cash accounting. Accrual accounting records transactions when revenues or expenses are realized
 *  or incurred, while cash accounting records transactions when the business actually spends or receives
 *  money.
 *
 *  Any time money flows between businesses or individuals, this flow is called a transaction. The flow of money
 *  between two accounts within an organization can also be called a transaction if treating it as such helps the
 *  company to track its finances accurately.
