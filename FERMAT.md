##Fermat: A Trustless Financial Application Framework


### Abstract

A trustless financial application framework would allow standalone crypto wallets to evolve into any kind of truthless financial applications. Crypto networks provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to transport metadata, synchronize devices, hold wallet files or keys, manage identities, interface crypto networks or the legacy financial system.

We propose a Peer-to-Peer network for transporting meta data and inter-connecting clients one to the other. A synchronization scheme complements it transforming a standalone app into a distributed application across several devices still owned by the same user.

The framework replaces the standalone wallet and enables the development of trustless financial applications that are both crypto-currency and digital-asset-enabled.

### Introduction

Standalone bitcoin wallets were the first trustless financial applications since they required to trust no third party inherating this property from the bitcoin network itself. As the ecosystem evolved trusted third parties were introduced again and they took over the wallet space because of technical capabilities that are easier to be built in a centralized way: communication between wallets, synchronization between devices, interfacing the legacy financial system, etc., and they consistently took the biggest share of funding, leaving standalone wallets far behind and at the same time trashing the trustless property of bitcoin, one of its key features. Applications trying to use the blockchain to trasport meta-data were considered spammers and trustless wallets were effectively left behind.

What is needed on top of all existing protocols is a layer that faces the end user and that finishes the job bitcoin started. By using crypto networks for transporting value or as a registry for digital assets and the Fermat network for transporting the required meta-data at a client level it would allow financial apps to run any user-level interconnected-functionality without ever going through a trusted party.

A plug-ins architecture allows any developer to add their own re-usable plugins. A micro-use-licensing scheme enforced by the system itself guarantees plugins, wallets, and apps developers a revenue stream. OS dependent GUI components are built on top of the multi-layered plug-ins structure to face the end user as niche-wallet applications or financial applications in general. Apps and wallets with similar functionality are wrapped into platforms, each one introducing new actors and plugins, to the ever increasing functionality of the whole system.

A built-in wallet-factory allows developers to reuse the higest level componets and create niche-wallets or niche-financial-apps by combining existing functionality and adding their own code to the combo. A built-in wallet-editor allows non-developers to reuse any of these niche-wallets to build new branded-wallets just by changing their look and feel. A built-in p2p-wallet-store allows end users to choose which wallets of financial apps to install from the ever growing catalog.
