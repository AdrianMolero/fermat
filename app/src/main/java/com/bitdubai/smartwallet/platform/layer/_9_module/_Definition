In this layer lives the functionality separated in modules. Each modules has a one to one correspondence with a sub-APP
at a user interface level. Modules serves UI components or other software using this library.

A module contains all the functionality needed for that specific sub-APP excluding the user interface and system-wide
services on which it relies. Each module is self contained and does not use other modules objects directly.
