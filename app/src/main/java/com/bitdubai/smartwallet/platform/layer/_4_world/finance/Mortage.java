/**
 * A mortgage loan, also referred to as a mortgage, is used by purchasers of real property to raise money to buy the
 * property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose. The loan is "secured" on
 * the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take
 * possession and sell the secured property ("foreclosure" or "repossession") to pay off the loan in the event that
 * the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word mortgage is derived from a
 * "law French" term used by English lawyers in the middle ages meaning "death pledge", and refers to the pledge ending
 * (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.
 *
 * Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property
 * (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The
 * lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on
 * the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries.
 * Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off
 * the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take
 * priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the
 * other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage
 * lender is repaid in full first.
