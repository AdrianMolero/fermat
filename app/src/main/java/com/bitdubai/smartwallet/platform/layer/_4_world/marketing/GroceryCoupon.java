/**
 * Grocery coupons are incentives for people who want to save money, but manufacturer coupons are primarily intended to
 * advertise products and lure new customers with financial incentives. They may also be used to increase the sales of
 * newspapers or other publications. For example, people may purchase multiple copies of a newspaper or magazine in
 * order to use the coupons contained within.
 *
 * Some grocery stores regularly double the value of a grocery coupon as an incentive to bring customers into their
 * stores. Additionally, stores might hold special events where they will double or triple coupon values on certain
 * days or weeks. Whether or not a specific grocery chain will double or triple coupons usually depends on the original
 * coupon value.[6] For example, many Kroger-owned stores double coupons with a value of $0.50 or under.[citation needed]
