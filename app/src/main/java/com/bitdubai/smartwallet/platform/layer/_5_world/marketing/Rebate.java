/**
 * A rebate is an amount paid by way of reduction, return, or refund on what has already been paid or contributed. It
 * is a type of sales promotion that marketers use primarily as incentives or supplements to product sales. The
 * mail-in rebate (MIR) is the most common. A MIR entitles the buyer to mail in a coupon, receipt, and barcode in
 * order to receive a check for a particular amount, depending on the particular product, time, and often place of
 * purchase. Rebates are offered by either the retailer or the manufacturer of the chosen product. Large stores often
 * work in conjunction with manufacturers, usually requiring two or even three separate rebates for each item.
 * Manufacturer rebates are sometimes valid only at a single store. Rebate forms and special receipts are sometimes
 * printed by the cash register at time of purchase on a separate receipt or available online for download. In some
 * cases, the rebate may be available immediately, in which case it is referred to as an instant rebate. Some rebate
 * programs offer several payout options to consumers, including a paper check, a prepaid card that can be spent
 * immediately without a trip to the bank, or even PayPal payout.
