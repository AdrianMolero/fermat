A foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a legal categorization of nonprofit organizations that will typically
either donate funds and support to other organizations, or provide the source of funding for its own charitable
purposes.

This type of non-profit organization differs from a private foundation which is typically endowed by an individual or
family.
