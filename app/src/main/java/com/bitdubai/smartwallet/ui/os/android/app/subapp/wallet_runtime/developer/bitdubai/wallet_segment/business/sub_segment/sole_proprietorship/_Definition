A sole proprietorship, also known as the sole trader or simply a proprietorship, is a type of business entity that is
owned and run by one natural person and in which there is no legal distinction between the owner and the business. The
owner is in direct control of all elements and is legally accountable for the finances of such business and this may
include debts, loans, loss etc.

The owner receives all profits (subject to taxation specific to the business) and has unlimited responsibility for all
losses and debts. Every asset of the business is owned by the proprietor and all debts of the business are the
proprietor's. It is a "sole" proprietorship in contrast with partnerships (which have at least 2 owners).

A sole proprietor may use a trade name or business name other than his, her or its legal name. They will have to
legally trademark their business name, the process being different depending upon country of residence.
