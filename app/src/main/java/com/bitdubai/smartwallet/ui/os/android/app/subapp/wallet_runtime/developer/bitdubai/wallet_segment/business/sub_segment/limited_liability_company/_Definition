A limited liability company (LLC) is the U.S.-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure
that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a
corporation.[1] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its
owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[2] In certain U.S. states, (Texas for
example) businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical
services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a very similar entity called a Professional
Limited Liability Company (PLLC).
