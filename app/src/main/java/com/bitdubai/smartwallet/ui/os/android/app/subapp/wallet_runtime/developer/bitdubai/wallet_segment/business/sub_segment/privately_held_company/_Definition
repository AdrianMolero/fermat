A privately held company or close corporation is a business company owned either by non-governmental organizations or
by a relatively small number of shareholders or company members which does not offer or trade its company stock
(shares) to the general public on the stock market exchanges, but rather the company's stock is offered, owned and
traded or exchanged privately. More ambiguous terms for a privately held company are unquoted company and unlisted
company.
