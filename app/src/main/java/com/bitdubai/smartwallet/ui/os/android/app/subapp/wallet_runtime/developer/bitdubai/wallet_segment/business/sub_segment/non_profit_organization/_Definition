A nonprofit organization (NPO) is an organization that uses surplus revenues to achieve its goals rather than
distributing them as profit or dividends.

Although nonprofit organizations are permitted to generate surplus revenues, they must be retained by the organization
for its self-preservation, expansion, or plans.[3] NPOs have controlling members or a board of directors. Many have
paid staff including management, whereas others employ unpaid volunteers and even executives who work with or without
compensation (occasionally nominal).Where there is a token fee, in general, it is used to meet legal requirements for
establishing a contract between the executive and the organization.

Designation as a nonprofit does not mean that the organization does not intend to make a profit, but rather that the
organization has no owners and that the funds realized in the operation of the organization will not be used to benefit
any owners. The extent to which an NPO can generate surplus revenues may be constrained or use of surplus revenues may
be restricted.
