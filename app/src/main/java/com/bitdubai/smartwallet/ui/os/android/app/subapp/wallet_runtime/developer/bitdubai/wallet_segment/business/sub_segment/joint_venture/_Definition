A joint venture (JV) is a business agreement in which the parties agree to develop, for a finite time, a new entity and
new assets by contributing equity. They exercise control over the enterprise and consequently share revenues, expenses
and assets. There are other types of companies such as JV limited by guarantee, joint ventures limited by guarantee
with partners holding shares.

In European law, the term 'joint venture' (or joint undertaking) is an elusive legal concept, better defined under the
rules of company law. In France, the term 'joint venture' is variously translated as 'association d'entreprises',
'entreprise conjointe', 'coentreprise' or 'entreprise commune'. In Germany, 'joint venture' is better represented as a
'combination of companies' (Konzern).

With individuals, when two or more persons come together to form a temporary partnership for the purpose of carrying
out a particular project, such partnership can also be called a joint venture where the parties are "co-venturers".

The venture can be for one specific project only - when the JV is referred to more correctly as a consortium (as the
building of the Channel Tunnel) - or a continuing business relationship. The consortium JV (also known as a cooperative
agreement) is formed where one party seeks technological expertise or technical service arrangements, franchise and
brand use agreements, management contracts, rental agreements, for one-time contracts. The JV is dissolved when that
goal is reached.
