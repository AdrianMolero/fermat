/**
 * Forward transactions are financial arrangements that involve the purchase a product at a fixed price, with the terms
 * of the sale identifying a specific date in the future that the product will be delivered to the buyer. This type of
 * arrangement may be used in the process of trading investments such as stocks, or as part of a currency trading
 * strategy. In most cases, the forward transaction date will be at least two full calendar days before the actual
 * delivery date.
 *
 * As part of a forward transaction agreement, a contract is drafted and used to define the specifics of the
 * arrangement between the buyer and the seller. While the provisions of the contract will vary somewhat, depending on
 * any laws or regulations that apply to the jurisdiction in which the transaction is taking place, most will include a
 * detailed description of the product that is being sold, the fixed price involved in the sale, the terms for
 * delivering payment, and the sale date. In addition, the terms of the agreement will also identify the specific date
 * that the product is to be delivered to the buyer. Additional details such as the mode of delivery may also be
 * addressed in the contract, along with specifications of who is responsible for any delivery costs and other fees
 * related to the forward transaction.
 *
 * When used as an investment strategy, the forward transaction can be helpful in securing assets that are anticipated
 * to increase in value within a specified period of time. The investor purchases the asset or security, locking in a
 * price based on current market value and agrees to the delivery of that security at some point in the future.
 * Assuming that the security does in fact appreciate in value in the interim, the investor ultimately receives an
 * asset that worth more than the purchase price. As a result, a return on the investment is generated and the investor
 * has the option of holding the security as it continues to appreciate, or selling it to realize the profit soon after
 * delivery.
