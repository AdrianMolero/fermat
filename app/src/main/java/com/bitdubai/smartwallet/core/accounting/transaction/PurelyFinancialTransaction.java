/**
 * A loan is a perfect example of a purely financial transaction. The borrower requests a certain amount of money to
 * make a large purpose, for example a car. The lender pays out a lump sum. Over months or years, the borrower returns
 * the money with interest. The net value of both the borrower and the lender change several times throughout this
 * transaction, but nothing changes hands except currency.
