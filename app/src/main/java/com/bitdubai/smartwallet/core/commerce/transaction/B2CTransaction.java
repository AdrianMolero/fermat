/**
 * A business-to-consumer (B2C) transaction is an exchange through which a business serves a final product to the end
 * user without intermediary entities like retail outlets or middlemen. Applications of the business-to-consumer
 * concept have transformed the way businesses interact with the market. There is a marked operational difference
 * between companies that implement the B2C model and companies that utilize the business-to-business (B2B) model, the
 * previously prevalent technique of business-to-consumer interaction. The Internet was instrumental in the shift from
 * the B2B, or retail model, to the B2C paradigm. Many of the most successful and recognizable business-to-consumer
 * operations are implemented over the Internet and are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach towards
 * reaching consumers directly.
 *
 * In the B2B, or retail model, producing businesses distribute their products to businesses like retail outlets or
 * distributors that sell the products to the end consumers. Supply chains guide the product from its origins in a
 * factory to the hands of the customer. Depending on the nature of the product and its accessibility to the customer,
 * these chains can be a couple of links to many dozens of links long. Furthermore, the eventual transaction is between
 * the customer and the last business in the chain, which means that businesses all along the supply chain will take
 * marginal profits for their efforts. With a business-to-consumer setup, however, there is only one transaction, with
 * the sole middlemen being the carrier that transports the goods.
 *
 * As cumbersome as it seems, the B2B was the best way to distribute goods at one point in time. The Internet, however,
 * changed that by allowing business to set up a virtual presence in cyberspace that consumers could use to directly
 * purchase wares. E-commerce and banking solutions that enabled online transactions made the process of paying for a
 * product as simple as a few clicks, making business-to-consumer transactions incredibly convenient for both the
 * business and the consumer.
