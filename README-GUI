## Introduction

GUI Components are one of the three basic components that can be added into the Fermat Framework. The two others are Addons, and Plugins. Enach GUI component has a well defined responsability within the system at usually collaborate from within one or more workflows in which it participates.  

To accomplish it's mission, a GUI component must have a wireframe.


<br>

## Part I: Concepts

Several new concepts are introduced...

<br>
### Developer Class

<br>
### Plug-in Root

<br>
### Plug-in Public Interface

<br>
### Internal Structure

<br>
### Event Handler

<br>
### Database

<br>
### Agents


<br>

## Parte II: Workflow

This section will help you undestand the workflow needed to be followed in order to implement a Plugin in Fermat.

<br>
### Getting Organized

#### Issues

It is mandatory that you create an initial set of github issues before you proceed further on the workflow. This will show the rest of the temas that someone is working in this functionality and avoid conflicting work early on. It will also hook the team leader into your workflow and allow him to guide and advise you when needed.

A basic hiriarchy of issues is created as a first step. The issues are linked one to the other just by placing a link on the first commet.

##### Naming Convention

Where we refer to '_Plugin Name_' what we expect is the following information:

* Platform or Super Layer name - 3 characters.
* Layer name
* Plug-in name

All of them seprated by " - ". 

##### Linking to parent Issue

Issues that needs to be linked to it's parent must have their first line starting with "Parent: " + http link to parent issue. 

##### Tagging the team leader

Team leaders are tagged in the second line in order to ask them to assign the issue to you and at the same time suscribe to any issue update. This helps team leaders to follow the issue events and provide assistance or guidance is they see something wrong. The suggested format is:

"@team-leader-user-name please assign this issue to me."

<br>
#### Plug-in Issue Structure

The mandatory initial structure is the following: (note: the word ISSUE it is not part of the name)

<br>
##### ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Plug-In

This is the root of your issue structure and must be labeled as _SUPER ISSUE_. It is closed only when all of it's children and grand children are closed.

<br>
##### ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Analisys - Super issue

This is the Analisys root. It is closed whenever all analisys is done. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

<br>
1 - ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Module - prototype**

This is the hardcoded module. Used for make the GUI prototype without use the fermat platform. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

<br>
2 - ISSUE: **'_Plugin Name_' - Module - connection**

This is the module connectad with fermat platform. Used for make the GUI using the fermat platform. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

<br>
3 - ISSUE: **'_Plugin Name_' - GUI - screen - <screen_name>

This issue is for a specific wireframe of a screen.

<br>

<br>
##### ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Testing

This is the Testing root. It is closed whenever all testing is done. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

* ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Testing - Unit Testing

* ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Testing - Integration Testing
 
 
<br>
##### ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - QA
 

This is the QA root. It is closed whenever QA tests are passed. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

It is expected to have here child issues in the form '_Plugin Name_' QA - Bug Fix n, where n is both the number and the bug name.

<br>
##### ISSUE: '_Plugin Name_' - Production

This is the Production root. It is closed whenever the Plug-in reaches production. It can be re-opened if bug issues are found on production and closed again once they are fixed. This issue must be linked to the root of the issue structure.

It is expected to have here child issues in the form  '_Plugin Name_' Production - Bug Fix n, where n is both the number and the bug name.


<br>
### Analisys

#### Pulic Interfaces

#### Database Model

#### Internal Structure Class Model

<br>
### Implementation

#### Developer Class

#### Plug-in Root

#### Database

#### Structure

##### Structure Root

##### Structure Clasess

##### Agents

#### Event Handlers


<br>

## Parte III: How to do it

<br>
### Analisys

#### Pulic Interfaces

##### How do we define the public interfaces?

##### How many interfaces can a Plug-in have?

##### Where do public interfaces must be loceted?

While you are analizing the public interfaces you might wanto to do it by writing it's code. Then your next question may be where to do it.

#### Database Model

##### How do we think about the Database Model of the Plug-in?

##### How do we choose between a Database or a File?

##### How much data is it allowed to keep?

##### Which are the sustainability policies?

#### Internal Structure Class Model

##### How free Am I to choose a class model for the internal structure?


<br>
### Implementation

#### Developer Class

#### Plug-in Root

#### Database

#### Structure

##### Structure Root

##### Structure Clasess

##### Agents

#### Event Handlers
