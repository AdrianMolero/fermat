trust is the base of the existing financial institutions, and this trust has been too easily abused!

sakamotos "with e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless"

nearly all of our money systems today are based on debt !

Bitcoin is not like this, because it isn’t borrowed into existence. Whether you acquire bitcoin through “mining” or through trade, neither you nor anyone else is inherently obligated to repay it eventually to someone else. You have complete title and ownership, and you alone control its disposition.

Bitcoin encourages us to adopt a rather fascinatingly different view of money than we’re used to: one that unconditionally honors and empowers each individual, that doesn’t condition its existence upon debt, that incentivizes honesty over fraud, that can’t be manipulated in quantity to benefit some people at the expense of others, and that is provably fair and honest by way of a distributed public ledger

Remember those private cryptographic keys mentioned earlier? Those are not just the keys to your bitcoins — they are also key to your control.

When you take responsibility to protect the keys yourself, you are in sole control of the bitcoins they unlock. For some people, this kind of responsibility can be understandably uncomfortable or inconvenient, and you might like to delegate the responsibility to someone els

There is a whole class of possible contract-based systems that could be self-enforcing and self-regulating through the use of the same distributed block chain technology that Bitcoin is based on, and a number of ambitious projects have already begun to build these; several are listed in the Resources section below.

This is an exciting area of development to watch, as old and corrupt centralized systems are gradually obsoleted by new decentralized systems that honor the integrity of every participant and are provably fair and honest.

Today's Copernican flip: How putting collaborative learning at the hub of human evolution improves our chances of survival

ABSTRACT Civilization is reinventing itself, much as it did 500 years ago in the shift from medieval to modern patterns of society. This time, the modern, mechanistic, imperialistic approach to life is failing and a new, ‘collaborative learning species’ vision of humanity and ‘ecosystem’ view of Global Integral Civilization is rising to take its place. Systems science stands at the heart of a new, integral stage of science that supports this new stage of civilization, not only with empirical and methodological detail, but also with a solid foundation for the new cultural and economic understandings. The result is a Copernican flip in our scientific view of the world and a new Enlightenment movement beginning to gather force throughout the world. Yet, though the ideas, the technologies, the ennobling inspiration and even the popular desire for this new era already exist, so far they remain diffuse and disjoint—obscured, suffocated and intimidated beneath the powerful pressures of business as usual. Today's challenge is to use the new scientific framework to build the intellectual clarity, common-cause unity and social infrastructure needed to achieve the next stage in human development by channelling these positive forces into a self-sustaining, actively learning whole.

As a developer, I see bitcoin as akin to the Internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation.

Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination. Bitcoin consists of:

A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)

A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)

A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining)

A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script)

However, neither Satoshi Nakamoto nor anyone else exerts control over the bitcoin system, which operates based on fully transparent mathematical principles. The invention itself is groundbreaking and has already spawned new science in the fields of distributed computing, economics, and econometrics.


In bitcoin terms, "spending" is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a bitcoin address.The "puzzle" used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted.
