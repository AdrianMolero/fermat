A limited partnership is a form of partnership similar to a general partnership, except that in addition to one or more
general partners (GPs), there are one or more limited partners (LPs). It is a partnership in which only one partner is
required to be a general partner.

The GPs are, in all major respects, in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm, i.e. they have
management control, share the right to use partnership property, share the profits of the firm in predefined
proportions, and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership.

As in a general partnership, the GPs have actual authority, as agents of the firm, to bind all the other partners in
contracts with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. As with a general
partnership, "an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited
partnership's activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership
only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners."
