# Fermat Protocol

The Fermat Protocol is an open standard meaning that can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. The protocol defines how both Fermat nodes and clients should behave.  

We expect the protocol to evolve through time to address miss behaviours and mitigate attacks. The protocol may be adapted in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

## Fermat Application Tokens

![alt text](https://github.com/bitDubai/media-kit/blob/master/Readme%20Image/Background/Front_Bitcoin_scn_low.jpg "Fermat Application Token")

Fermat generates its tokens, the fermats, with a predetermined algorithm that cannot be changed, and those tokens are necessary for Fermat to function. Fermat miners are rewarded with fermats for their contributions in running the Fermat network.

These application token are native to the Fermat system and are necessary for access to the application. Contribution of value from miners are rewarded in the application’s tokens as well as developers which are rewarded with tokens for the Plug-ins they build for the system.

### Token Records

Fermat's tokes data and records are cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure. This blockchain is stored at Fermat nodes.

Fermat blockchain only records the issuing of new fermats and outsources the transaction processing from the bitcoin network. 

### Token Generation & Distribution

Fermat implement three different mechanisms for token generation and distribution:

#### Fund-raising Mechanism

With the fund-raising mechanism, tokens are distributed to those who fund the initial development of the Fermat system. The funds collected are used to fund the development of the core of the Fermat system (core libriaries, api libraries, add-ons and the fermat.org web site). The tokens generated during the fund-raising are recorded as the genesis transaction of the Fermat's blockchain.

#### Development Mechanism

With the development mechanism, tokens are generated using a predefined mechanism and are only available for the development of Fermat components (plug-ins, GUI components, skins, language packages, and analisys of future development). These fermats become available through a pre-determined schedule and are distributed via a community-driven bounty system where decisions are made based on the proof-of-stake mechanism.

#### Mining Mechanism

The Fermat Protocol generates tokens according to a standard crytptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application (Fermat uses a kind of Proof of Work Algorithm designed for the particular services Fermat nodes are providing).

With the mining mechanism, tokens are distributed to those who contribute most work to the operation of the Fermat Network. In this case, fermats are distributed through a predetermined algorithm to the miners that connect clients between each other and allows them to talk through them.

### Token Issuing

#### Fermat.org (Non-profit organization)

Fund-raising Fermat tokens are issued by a non-profit organization called Fermat.org that will never receive financial benefits from the Fermat system. This organization have the following responsibilities:

* Issuance of initial tokens
* Holding of developer tokens
* Management of bounty payments
* Determining the Fermat System direction
* Collecting and distributing statistical information from the Fermat System.

Fermat.org makes decisions in a decentralized manner, using a “proof of stake” voting mechanism for any decision.

#### Fermat Protocol

The protocol itself issues tokens for miners and for development. In the last case, thay are deposited on accounts of the Fermat.org Non-profit until awarded as bounty payments for developers. 

### Token Usage

End users automatically aquires fermats by receiving bitcoins into a their Fermat wallet. They can go back to bitcoin by transfering fermats into a Bitcoin wallet. 

Fermat tokes are necesary for users to pay for three things:

#### Communication

End Users pay Fermat Nodes with fermats to be able to receive calls from other devices. 

#### Use of Fermat Components

End Users pay Fermat Component's developers with fermats to be able to use their plug-ins, GUI components, skins, language packages, etc. Developers defines a Micro-Use-License for each components. Products like Wallets or Financial APPs use these components, so the cost for using these products is the sum of the cost of the Micro-Use-Licenses defined by each developer involved. This is the way how developers are paid for mantaining their components.

#### Technical Support

End Users pay with fermats to receive personalized technical support from Fermat Component's developers.

## The Fermat Network

### Peer-to-Peer Network Architecture

The Fermat Network is structured as a peer-to-peer network architecture on top of the Internet. Fermat nodes are peers to each other, meaning that they are all equal and there are no "special" nodes. All the nodes share the burden of providing all services. The network nodes interconnect to each other only when they need to do so according to the Fermat P2P Protocol. There is no server, no centralized service, and no hierarchy within the network. 

The term "Fermat Network" refers to the collection of nodes running the Fermat P2P Protocol. In addition to the Fermat P2P Protocol, there are other protocols such as the Fermat Consensus Protocol which allows the network to agree which transactions are going to be recorded on the blockchain, and the Fermat Client Protocol which is used for coomunicating Fermat Clients between each other and to Fermat Nodes. We use the term "Extended Fermat Network" to refer to the overall network that includes both Fermat Nodes and Clients.

## Fermat Protocol Version 1.0

The Fermat Protocol spans through Fermat Nodes and Fermat Clients. It defines the internal rules on each of them and also the rules of engagement between each other.

### Fermat Nodes

Fermat nodes performs several tasks at the same time. For each one of them, the protocol has it own set of rules:

#### Mantains the Distributed Nodes Catalogue

Each node mantains a full catalogue of all nodes registered in the network.

#### Mantains an Identities Catalogue

Each node mantains a part of a distributed catalogue of the End User identities. This catalogue is designed to facilitate End Users to find each other.

#### Act as Identities' Home

Each node is home to a set of End Users identities. These identities can receive calls only through their home node.

#### Acts as a Call Bridge

Each node interconects clients between each other in order to let them freely transfer information between them.

#### Mantains the Fermat Blockchain

Each node mantains the Fermat Blockchain: a public record of all coinbase transactions where the protocol issues new fermats.

### Fermat Clients

Fermat clients run the Fermat Framework, which in turn run the Fermat Components (libraries, add-ons, plug-ins, GUIs, etc.).
