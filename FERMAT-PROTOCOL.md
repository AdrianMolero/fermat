# Fermat Protocol

The Fermat Protocol is an open standard meaning that can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. The protocol defines how both Fermat nodes and clients should behave.  

We expect the protocol to evolve through time to address miss behaviours and mitigate attacks. The protocol may be adapted in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

## Fermat Application Tokens

Fermat generates its tokens, the fermats, with a predetermined algorithm that cannot be changed, and those tokens are necessary for Fermat to function. Fermat miners are rewarded with fermats for their contributions in running the Fermat network.

These application token are native to the Fermat system and are necessary for access to the application. Contribution of value from miners are rewarded in the applicationâ€™s tokens as well as developers which are rewarded with tokens for the Plug-ins they built for the system.

### Token Records

Fermat's tokes data and records are cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure. This blockchain is stored at Fermat nodes.

### Token Generation

The Fermat Protocol generates tokens according to a standard crytptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application (Fermat uses a kind of Proof of Work Algorithm designed for the particular services Fermat nodes are providing).
