# Fermat Protocol

The Fermat Protocol is an open standard meaning that can be freely adopted, implemented and extended. The protocol defines how both Fermat nodes and clients should behave.  

We expect the protocol to evolve through time to address miss behaviours and mitigate attacks. The protocol may be adapted in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

## Fermat Application Tokens

Fermat generates its tokens, the fermats, with a predetermined algorithm that cannot be changed, and those tokens are necessary for Fermat to function. Fermat miners are rewarded with fermats for their contributions in running the Fermat network.

These application token are native to the Fermat system and are necessary for access to the application. Contribution of value from miners are rewarded in the applicationâ€™s tokens as well as developers which are rewarded with tokens for the Plug-ins they build for the system.

### Token Records

Fermat's tokes data and records are cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure. This blockchain is stored at Fermat nodes.

Fermat blockchain only records the issuing of new fermats and outsources the transaction processing from the bitcoin network. 

### Token Generation & Distribution

Fermat implement three different mechanisms for token generation and distribution:

#### Fund-raising Mechanism

With the fund-raising mechanism, tokens are distributed to those who fund the initial development of the Fermat system. The funds collected are used to fund the development of the core of the Fermat system (core libriaries, api libraries and add-ons and the fermat.org web site). The tokens generated during the fund-raising are recorded as the genesis transaction of the Fermat's blockchain.

#### Development Mechanism

With the development mechanism, tokens are generated using a predefined mechanism and are only available for the development of Fermat components (plug-ins, GUI components, skins, language packages, and analisys of future development). These fermats become available through a pre-determined schedule and are distributed via a community-driven bounty system where decisions are made based on the proof-of-stake mechanism.

#### Mining Mechanism

The Fermat Protocol generates tokens according to a standard crytptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application (Fermat uses a kind of Proof of Work Algorithm designed for the particular services Fermat nodes are providing).

With the mining mechanism, tokens are distributed to those who contribute most work to the operation of the Fermat Network. In this case, fermats are distributed through a predetermined algorithm to the miners that connect clients between each other and allows them to talk through them.
