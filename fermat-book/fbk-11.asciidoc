This platform ....

=== _Network Service layer_
Each time that a certain system function must perform any operation *outside* the device where FERMAT is running, a _network service_ is required to follow the execution in other devices until is completed. +
Network services' modules need to have a * communication channel* stablished and maintained between the parties involved, what is done by the *P2P networks and communication superlayer* ( see the explanation at the previous section <<communicationLayer>> )+
Each *network service module* running on a _local device_ stablish communication EXCLUSIVELY to its _counterpart_ running in the _remote device_. +
