== FERMAT Plug-ins Platform

*FERMAT Plug-ins Platform* is open source and run on end usersâ€™ devices. It allows third party developers to extend the platform functionality thereby enabling quick adaption to a rapidly evolving environment. A micro licensing system allows plug-ins and segment specific wallet developers to profit from their investment and motivates any member of the community to participate in the project bringing in even more knowledge and ideas in a quick, efficient and profitable way. +
This platform encapsulates all the modules that provides the basic services that build the back end infrastructure of FERMAT multiplatform system with the architectural characteristics that we have already explored in the previous section <<architecture>>. +
FERMAT <<multilayer>> and <<layersExplanation>> are the starting point for the next sections where we take one plaftform at a time and describe which tasks platform's specific plugins are responsible of. 


=== _Platform Services layer_
In this platform, modules in this layer handle exceptions and events: 

Error Manager :: it handles the _unexpected exceptions_, contacting the developer of the plugin where the exception occured to let him solve it. 
Event Manager :: it keeps track of the _events_ occurring alongside the entire platform to let plugins listen to the events that correspond to its function to trigger the corresponding plugin activity.

=== _Hardware layer_
As FERMAT runs distributed in different devices, this layer has the modules necessary to identify each of this devices _independently_ of the user that is logged in, and also to provide all the device's information that is needed for the system to run.+

=== _Users layer_
FERMAT is a multiuser and multidevice system. Therefore, depending on how the user interacts with FERMAT, users are divided into certain _users categories_ which allow to properly handle the user's activity within FERMAT. +
 
Device User :: + this module handles transactions that take place inside the same device, an the user is identified in FERMAT as a *Device User*


=== _Plugin layer_
Identity ::
Dependency :: +


=== _License layer_
FERMAT system ensures a _microlicense_ system to let the developer of a certain plug-in or certain wallet or any other module to charge a *fee* for the use of the component, and the revenue is enforced programmatically by FERMAT to reach the license owner.
