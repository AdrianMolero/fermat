== What is FERMAT? 

*FERMAT* is:
 
* an inspired *vision* about exploring and expanding the potentially biggest technological development since the invention of internet: *blockchain technology*. + 
* a pioneer *project* to manifest a *master plan* to lay the foundations for a new era of collaborative environments in software industry and financial technologies +
* a *group* of passionate *entrepreneurs* and *developers* devoting creativity and effort to bring the project to life +
* an *invitation* to the steady growing *community* supporting the creation of sustainable collective decentralized environments +
* a *service* to extend this amazing technology to a whole *world* of potential users respecting their uniqueness and freedom of choice  +
* a *system of software platforms* to build services and create new products on top, reusing the collective inteligence to evolve more efficiently and with greater global coherence. +

=== The vision
As we firmly believe that the next decade will witness crypto currencies going mainstream and governments issuing digital currency as well, we expect paper money is going to disappear within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for *digital wallets* will inevitably emerge. In order to meet this demand thousands of diferent wallets should be available, different not only in terms of the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing crypto currencies while others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their appearance and how they feel to the user, as well as differencies in their functionalities.
However, although a huge step has been made by Sakamoto's invention - in fact Bitcoin that has already become the first widely accepted cryptocurrency and its technology has become a standard - there is still too many technical aspects in using blockchain tech that this prevents it for being mass adopted. 
What's more, in the last years, there has been a lot of fin tech investment money given to a myriad of startup initiating in bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and everything has gone so far that after "bitcoin revolution" the new trending wave of investenment is focus on what has been called "cryptocurrency 2.0". Nevertheless, there is still a point of view that is "out of tune" with the very nature and essence of this inventions: is not so wise to run "solo"the race to conquer the world market, because there is so much that has to be done, that is better to do it in a collaborative way, relying on the lessons of open source software and global projects with a "systemic view" of the interaction between the involved parties (individual or organizations) and the whole.
 
So, the challenge that we are nowadays facing in this industry is related to finding the answers to the following questions:

* How can we isolate ordinary people from the perceived complexity? 
* How can we use the collective intelligence of the developer community? 
* How can we reuse the entire current infrastructure already in place? 
* How do we integrate legacy financial institutions in a way they feel comfortable? 
* How do we integrate merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes in a clever way?

The answers to each of these questions are addressed within the FERMAT platform.

In this era of a digitalised world, there are so many people who earn their living generating products and services at the heart of this digital world, being interconnected in an complex pattern of giving and receiving, services, money, assets, knowledge, permanently exchanging information of all kinds, weaving relationships, building a *global community*. + We do *believe* the community collectively has more talent than any of us individually. We *believe* it is important to build on top of services and knowledge that others took time and effort to build. + 
We _believe_ in *collaborative environments*. + 
We _believe_ that growth of individums may generate growth and wealth for everybody if only we dedicate effort to build collectively rather than individually, sharing a *common vision* with a certain level of attained consensus on a "master plan for development". +
We also believe in *decentralization* . +

NOTE: With the rising of Internet and the giant proliferation of computers permanently connected , what turn "the web" nowadays into "the cloud, among the huge benefits of a myriad of services running 24 hours on-line, we have also witnessed some vulnerability of systems totally dependent on a specific server ( or net of servers) when they crashed victim of hackers attack or when they were banned or controlled by goverments or central institutions not only causing data and money loses, but also spreading an awkward feeling of mistrust and being abused.
At the contrary, a new era of *distributed systems* which run on a *decentralized peer-to-peer network*, secured by the use of *cryptographic signatures* is being born, turning the old systems based on a "central"server or central point of control gradually obsolete. The demand of such distributed systems is getting bigger because they are naturally safer ( ther's no central point to attack or control) and they honor the integrity of every participant and are provably fair and honest.


In FERMAT we believe in people with passion and commitment to attain higher purposes, who are "crazy enough" and corageous to step forward and follow an *inspired vision*, to create a *critical mass* and start a *movement* that can change the world. We do believe we are collectively going to change this world and move forward to a prosperous future.

We believe in a vision of humanity as a COLLABORATIVE LEARNING SPECIES which can trascend current limitations of the mainstream worldview of survival and scarcity into an unlimited and (re)evolutionary conception of humanity leading the path towards a thriving ECOSYSTEM of a *Global Integral Civilisation*.

=== FERMAT's Mission: 

* To empower every person in the world with the appropriate tools to save and move their money in a digital format in an efficient, secure an private way. 
* To give back the souveraignity of each one's ressources respecting the freedom of choice, allowing each one to choose which currency to use and how to administrate it,  regardless of the place they live or where they were born.


=== The project: foundations for a master plan

We strive in FERMAT to lay foundational concepts, technologies and systems to support further developments in blockchain technology in such a way, that the *ecosystem* as a whole can evolve attaining a beautiful, efficient, fair and coherent result, integrating the resultating complexity into a well organized pattern, so as if this pattern had been previously premeditated. +
The analogy having a big architect wanting to design a new city can serves us for comparison as long as we explore FERMAT'S basic components and their development inside the master plan.

As every master plan, we have to consider that the plan has succesive phases of implementation. +
:numbered!:
==== PHASE I:

* First, we need the ground were to build: in this case, the ground is all the available technology available today in internet, specially the available open source software, and all the devices and network technologies that let digital communication be available at a massive level.
* Then, we need the basics services like in a city: electricity, gas, water supplies. In FERMAT the unified "company" that provides these servicies is the first platform in the stack, FERMAT-COR (FERMAT CORE PLATFORM), and the basic services supplied are:
** FERMAT-OSA (FERMAT OPERATING SYSTEMS API ) provides the  connection to the diferent OPERATIVE SYSTEMS (filesystems and data base systems) and general USER and HARDWARE identificaction 
** FERMAT-BCH (FERMAT BLOCKCHAIN) provides interconnectivity to crytonetworks and blockchain services providers
** FERMAT-P2P (FERMAT PEER-TO-PEER) provides NETWORK SERVICES to make possible communication and interconectivity inside FERMAT and with the outer world.
* The first visible infrastructure, or the first "building in the city", it is similar to a huge "main entrance hall" were citizen are identified and granted the permission to enter the city. 
** FERMAT-PIP (FERMAT PLUG-IN PLATFORM) provides the necessary services to interact (consume services) and develop (create your own) the basic components of the system, the PLUG-INS.

NOTE: At this stage of development, FERMAT already offers a wide scope of REUSABLE components for third parts to build on top, encouraging further development of the plan, enrichnening it with every single addition, which is more profitable for the whole and for the individual actor than struggling for conquering a small niche of a much more limited market with the great burden of building everything from zero point.

NOTE: *At FERMAT we firmly believe that the comunity has much more talent and intelligent collectively than isolated individuals. We strive to reach a world-wide difussion of the blockchain  ecosystem with the conviction that we are laying the foundations of a global collaborative endeavour. Our development is a firm call to peers and colleagues to commiting themselves to be part of the transformation we want to bring forth. We call upon corageous minds who dare to build something great.* 


==== PHASE II

Here comes the building of the next set of platforms within FERMAT, that covers the functionalities to offer a:
* a decentralized Wallet Production Line
* a Shop platform
* a Marketing platform
* a Crypto Broker platform
* a Crypto Distribution Network
* a Digital Asset platform
    
A more detailed description of each one of these follow in the next chapters.

=== FERMAT as a financial network
 
==== What's behind money?
In our daily live we have accepted money as something present in almost every activity of human endeavour, and most of us use it without reflecting on its origin or its deeper meaning. Making it simple, money is an agreed mean of exchanging value. By its universal adoption it allows a flow of products and services between the different actors in a producer-consumer chain ( or better, in a "web" of commercial interactions) and following this, an exchange of the value associated with each step, rewarding each actor with a portion of the entire value, what we call "profit". 
During the early ages trading was made directly exchanging certain goods for other goods, then as trading was growing at scale, the necessity of unification of mass and measures lead to the rising of money representing in some way the value of what was being exchange and a relative consensus over it. Later on, with the rising of the different nations which created a certain unification under certain name, language and goverment and rules to be applied to a determined territory and its inhabitants, this nations extended their souveranity also to the issue of a national currency and the printing of "official" paper money. At the begginning the amount of paper money was guaranteed by a national reserve on gold, what was no longer needed after .... ( complete). This means, that the current money we use only depends on the "trust" we deposit on the goverment that rules its emission and this "legal curse" is enforced by law. There is NOT ANY OTHER intrinsec propierty on paper money to ensure its value than this!! When talking about corruption in some of our political and financial institutions, we can easily perceive how often this trust has been abused.This kind of money enforced by law has been called *fiat money*.

==== Cryptocurrency
When Bitcoin solved the issues that prevented other digital currencies to become a viable digital money ( "authenticity" (of the issuing and ownership) and the "double-spend" problem) it opened a whole new world where cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user's claim to value. So, this new kind of currency that is entirely virtual and that is implied in transactiones that transfer value from sender to recipient based on crytographic signatures is what we call *cryptocurrency*

TIP: Taking Bitcoin as "the" paradigmatic model of every cryptocurrency, we need to have in mind that for Bitcoin to exist following is needed: +
* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol) + 
* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain) +
* A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining) +
* A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script) +

 that give the idea of a big  underlying the first sucessfully implemented cryptocurrency: *Bitcoin*. + 
The undeniable achievement of Bitcoin's electronic signature protocol based on *crytography* is the creation of a distributed public ledger of peer-to-peer electronic transactions that is transparent and at the same time preserves the anonimity and the security needed to become a safe way of transporting *value*. This technology opens the door to a new paradigma in economics, computer science, financial operations, and world-wide commerce. +  
Sakamoto's invention makes possible to unveil the world of financial transactions, to get rid of the necessity of *trust* into a third party institution or central goverments, to make money a secure thing, and transactions transparent and effortless. It returns to the money's owner the absolute control over his richnes. +
The cryptocurrency scheme encourages us to adopt a radical new point of view on money and the concept of value itself and its transport, so radical, that it will take us  time and effort to really grasp it, because it leads to the unconditionally honoring and empowering of each individual. 

--> consensus agreement to transport value from one point to another
