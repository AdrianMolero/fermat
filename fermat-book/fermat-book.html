<h3 id="_the_vision">1.1. The vision</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we firmly believe that the next decade will witness crypto currencies going mainstream and governments issuing digital currency as well, we expect paper money is going to disappear within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for <strong>digital wallets</strong> will inevitably emerge. In order to meet this demand thousands of diferent wallets should be available, different not only in terms of the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing crypto currencies while others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their appearance and how they feel to the user, as well as differencies in their functionalities.
However, although a huge step has been made by Sakamoto&#8217;s invention - in fact Bitcoin that has already become the first widely accepted cryptocurrency and its technology has become a standard - there is still too many technical aspects in using blockchain tech that this prevents it for being mass adopted.
What&#8217;s more, in the last years, there has been a lot of fin tech investment money given to a myriad of startup initiating in bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and everything has gone so far that after "bitcoin revolution" the new trending wave of investenment is focus on what has been called "cryptocurrency 2.0". Nevertheless, there is still a point of view that is "out of tune" with the very nature and essence of this inventions: is not so wise to run "solo"the race to conquer the world market, because there is so much that has to be done, that is better to do it in a collaborative way, relying on the lessons of open source software and global projects with a "systemic view" of the interaction between the involved parties (individual or organizations) and the whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, the challenge that we are nowadays facing in this industry is related to finding the answers to the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can we isolate ordinary people from the perceived complexity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we use the collective intelligence of the developer community?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we reuse the entire current infrastructure already in place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we integrate legacy financial institutions in a way they feel comfortable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we integrate merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes in a clever way?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answers to each of these questions are addressed within FERMAT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this era of a digitalised world, there are so many people who earn their living generating products and services at the heart of this digital world, being interconnected in an complex pattern of giving and receiving, services, money, assets, knowledge, permanently exchanging information of all kinds, weaving relationships, building a <strong>global community</strong>.<br>
We do <strong>believe</strong> the community collectively has more talent than any of us individually. We <strong>believe</strong> it is important to build on top of services and knowledge that others took time and effort to build.<br>
We <em>believe</em> in <strong>collaborative environments</strong>.<br>
We <em>believe</em> that growth of individums may generate growth and wealth for everybody if only we dedicate effort to build collectively rather than individually, sharing a <strong>common vision</strong> with a certain level of attained consensus on a "master plan for development".<br>
We also believe in <strong>decentralization</strong> .<br></p>

With the rising of Internet and the giant proliferation of computers permanently connected , what turn "the web" nowadays into "the cloud, among the huge benefits of a myriad of services running 24 hours on-line, we have also witnessed some vulnerability of systems totally dependent on a specific server ( or net of servers) when they crashed victim of hackers attack or when they were banned or controlled by goverments or central institutions not only causing data and money loses, but also spreading an awkward feeling of mistrust and being abused.
At the contrary, a new era of <strong>distributed systems</strong> which run on a <strong>decentralized peer-to-peer networks</strong>, secured by the use of <strong>cryptographic signatures</strong> is being born, turning the old systems based on a "central" servers or central point of control gradually obsolete. The demand of such distributed systems is getting bigger because they are naturally safer ( ther&#8217;s no central point to attack or control) and they honor the integrity of every participant and are provably fair and honest.

</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we need the basics services like in a city: electricity, gas, water supplies. In FERMAT the unified "company" that provides these servicies is the first platform in the stack, FERMAT-COR (FERMAT CORE PLATFORM), and the basic services supplied are:</p>
<div class="ulist">

</li>
<li>
<p>FERMAT-P2P (FERMAT PEER-TO-PEER) provides interconectivity to all kinds of devices running FERMAT.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first visible infrastructure, or the first "building in the city", it is similar to a huge "main entrance hall" were citizen are identified and granted the permission to enter the city.</p>

<h4 id="_what_s_behind_money">1.4.1. What&#8217;s behind money?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our daily live we have accepted money as something present in almost every activity of human endeavour, and most of us use it without reflecting on its origin or its deeper meaning. Making it simple, money is an agreed mean of exchanging value. By its universal adoption it allows a flow of products and services between the different actors in a producer-consumer chain ( or better, in a "web" of commercial interactions) and following this, an exchange of the value associated with each step, rewarding each actor with a portion of the entire value, what we call "profit".
During the early ages trading was made directly exchanging certain goods for other goods, then as trading was growing at scale, the necessity of unification of mass and measures lead to the rising of money representing in some way the value of what was being exchange and a relative consensus over it. Later on, with the rising of the different nations which created a certain unification under certain name, language and goverment and rules to be applied to a determined territory and its inhabitants, this nations extended their souveranity also to the issue of a national currency and the printing of "official" paper money. At the begginning the amount of paper money was guaranteed by a national reserve on gold, but most of goverment abandoned the * gold standard* after the 1930 world crisis, and after 1971 the US goverment severed definitely the link between US Dollar to gold. This means, that the current money we use only depends on the "trust" we deposit on the goverment that rules its emission and this "legal curse" is enforced by law. There is NOT ANY OTHER intrinsec propierty on paper money to ensure its value than this!! When talking about corruption in some of our political and financial institutions, we can easily perceive how often this trust has been abused. This kind of money enforced by law which value is not linked to any specific asset has been called <strong>fiat money</strong>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cryptocurrency">1.4.2. Cryptocurrency</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Bitcoin solved the issues that prevented other digital currencies to become a viable digital money ( "authenticity" (of the issuing and ownership) and the "double-spend" problem) it opened a whole new world in financial systems and economy, where cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user&#8217;s claim to value. So, this new kind of currency that is entirely virtual and that is implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient based on crytographic signatures is what we call <strong>cryptocurrency</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
The undeniable achievement of Bitcoin&#8217;s electronic signature protocol based on <strong>crytography</strong> is the creation of a distributed public ledger of peer-to-peer electronic transactions that is transparent and at the same time preserves the anonimity and the security needed to become a safe way of transporting <strong>value</strong>, based on <strong>consensus agreement</strong>. This technology opens the door to a new paradigma in economics, computer science, financial operations, and world-wide commerce.<br>
Sakamoto&#8217;s invention makes possible to unveil the world of financial transactions, to get rid of the necessity of <strong>trust</strong> into a third party institution or central goverments, to make money a secure thing, and transactions transparent and effortless. It returns to the money&#8217;s owner the absolute control over his richnes.<br>
The cryptocurrency scheme encourages us to adopt a radical new point of view on money and the concept of value itself and its transport, so radical, that it will take us  time and effort to really grasp it, because it leads to the unconditionally honoring and empowering of each individual.

Taking Bitcoin as "the" paradigmatic model of every cryptocurrency, we need to have in mind that for Bitcoin to exist following is needed:<br>
* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)<br>
* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)<br>
* A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining)<br>
* A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script)<br>

<h3 id="_what_makes_fermat_different_from_other_wallet_platforms_or_services">2.1. What makes FERMAT different from other wallet platforms or services?</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FERMAT is P2P.</strong> This makes it censorship resistent and difficult to be attacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FERMAT is built with plugins.</strong> This enables functionality to be reused and opens the door to any developer to participate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FERMAT is inclusive.</strong> By creating their own plugins, current industry members can integrate with FERMAT to offer their services and products to FERMAT user base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FERMAT runs on end users' devices.</strong> This enables users to hold their own money eliminating the need to trust a third party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FERMAT segments the world population and offers a custom tailored solution for each segment.</strong> Any developer can easily create niche wallets for a particular group of people. Brands can create their own wallets for their followers. All the heavy lifting is done by the FERMAT platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**FERMAT guaratees plugins and wallet developers a revenue stream.</p>

<li>
<p>**FERMAT implements an innovative business model which allows plugins and wallet developers to define a use license, and FERMAT itself enforces this license on behalf of developers. )</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first goal is to get very close to the <strong>end user</strong> offering and easy way of coming onboard the crytocurrency world by means of possesing a digital <strong>wallet</strong> running on his preferred device.<br>
At the same time, the open source <strong>plug-in platform</strong> allows any skilled actor in the community to jump in and develop applications and offer services with different abstraction levels and addressing a wide range of segmented markets. In fact, as we have seen in the section about FERMAT as a master plan, the possibility of using the existent global talent and intelligence that the community already has in a clever collaborative way, can rapidily expand this technology to mass adoption.<br>
Instead of beginning a new project in this industry completley from scratch, the clear and firm logic of FERMAT can make it a new standard in the industry, giving the collective a strong and stabile group coherence it had never experienced before. All participants in the different sectors get , because of FERMAT&#8217;s transparency, clear logic and solid foundations, a sense of trust, safety and equity, and the corresponding right to become a revenue for each one&#8217;s contribution and effort.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_s_architecture">2.4. FERMAT&#8217;s architecture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FERMAT as a system is built on several overlaping architectural paradigms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a higher level, it is a Peer to Peer system with asymetric nodes, meaning that each node even having all the code base, it specializes itself according to the profile of the end user or the way it was configured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside each node FERMAT features a Multi-OS architecture meaning that the lowest level OS-dependent components are wrapped in a way that can be easily replaced when running on a different OS without affecting the rest of the components consuming services from them. The upmost components, the ones facing the end user (GUI) are also OS-dependent. Everything in between is not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time it features a plugins architecture inserted into a multi-layered structure. These layers are ocasionally grouped into <strong>Superlayers</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These Plugins are subdivided into a hierarchy of <strong>Platforms</strong>. Those <strong>Platforms</strong> shares a common set of layers, and each one adds <strong>Actors</strong> and <strong>Products</strong> to the overall functionallity of the FERMAT system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside each Plugin, you might find a specialized structure and in many cases a database or files belonging to that plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a system level, FERMAT uses speciallized crawlers to collect or sometimes inject information into nodes in order to recreate a system level conciousness prepeared to resist attacks or other relevant issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_p2p_architecture">p2p architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FERMAT is a decentralized system, so it needs to stablish a connection between every actor and every device using it, and this is done by creating a P2P-NETWORK between them, based on the services provided by FERMAT-P2P Platform and its components.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_multi_os_architecture">multi OS architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FERMAT is <strong>code-base portable</strong>, meaning that the components are written in code that runs in different operating systems.
So, through FERMAT-OSA (FERMAT OPERATING SYSTEM API) , the components that are specific to a given Operating System connect to the rest of FERMAT that is OS independent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_multilayer_architecture">multilayer architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FERMAT needs to be adaptable, to provide highly component reutilisation, and to offer a scalability that match the complexity of the service that is running on it. Therefore the components are set in <strong>layers</strong> stacking one over the other. Each layer groups components that provide a similar functionality, eg. communications layer is designed to provide a way to connect one device to another building a "communications channel" using different available tecnologies ( cloud servers, wifi, NFT, etc), and in performing this task, it let other components from other layers do their specific task consumming services of this communication layer in a transparent way, without any concern on how the communication is actually being stablished.<br>
There are certain <strong>Layers</strong> that provide services at a system-wide scale (see <strong>superlayers</strong>), but other layers are defined within one <strong>platform</strong> and its modules offer and consume services to allow the platform offer its set of specific functionalities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plug_ins_architecture">plug-ins architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong> have an outstanding feature: as long as theier INTERFACE (i.e. the shape of the interconnection) is known and public, the plug-in can interact with others, consuming and offering services, INDEPENDENTLY of its inner structure and how it is built. As long as they conserve this INTERFACE, they can safely evolve to more efficient functioning WITHOUT altering a single service that has been built upon it !
Inside FERMAT, each plug-in is given certain specific responsability within the whole, it lives in a certain layer, and it is allowed to consume services of components on <em>lower layers</em> and to provide services to components of <em>upper layers</em>. Plug-ins participate in high level processes and they are programmed in a way to live in an uncontrolled environment (end user devices) and to co-exist with untrusted third party plug-ins as well.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptocurrencies live in a public and distributed ledger, the <strong>blockchain</strong> , in a decentralized p2p network (spread in every network node).<br>
They are held and stored by their owners in specific applications called <strong>wallets</strong> living in a certain device which has access to the corresponding cryptonetwork.<br>
<strong>Wallets</strong> store the owner&#8217;s <em>privat key</em> and the corresponding <em>public key</em> to unlock the cryptocurrency amount of a given <em>transaction</em>. For a <em>transaction</em> to take place, a <strong>crypto address</strong> is needed to identify both the sender of the value as well as the receiver. <strong>Crypto addresses</strong> are generated by the wallet derived from the <em>privat/public key</em> pair of the wallet&#8217;s owner.
Although <strong>wallets</strong> are similar in relationship to their basic functionalities, the natural segmentation of the world population requires to be taken into account when designing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_segmentation">segmentation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FERMAT understands that there exists on the world so many different tastes and preferences like humans exists on earth, because each one is unique, and therefore there are potentially so many differents ways of shaping the accessibility, appearance and functionality of applications dealing with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to match very specific need and scalable demand of each consumer&#8217;s niche. Here begins the huge differentation between FERMAT applications and the rest !<br>
FERMAT takes very seriously into account the actor&#8217;s profile to develop attractive applications in each case. Well, for some actor&#8217;s with more complex relationships world, more complexity is also wanted in ther wallets and in the wallet of kindred actor&#8217;s that interdepend and interact in the same <strong>niche</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_levels_of_abstraction">levels of abstraction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While certain actors need basic operations, others utilization of blockchain technology can required different levels of abstraction.
For instance, low abstraction is needed for user that only need to see their value in <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>. Other may want to haver their wallets showing them their content in * fiat money*. Others might need some functionalities that prevent them for <strong>losing value</strong> depending on the exchange rate they purchased the currency and when they want to spend it, and some of them would like to see the profitable exchange rate as a * discount* obtained in the purchase of goods.. There are also many who will only serve themselves of the cryptonetwork not to transport value, but to issue * digital assets* that are made public through the blockchain ledger&#8230;<br>
All this different * abstraction levels* are possible within FERMAT, and FERMAT&#8217;S PLATFORM are specifically designed to match certain needs of a niche and they foster the creation of a real-world environment, linking actors offering services with those consuming them.</p>

When all the basic infrastructure is layed out and some initial plug-ins are running, then the process thread turns to the <strong>OS application</strong> which starts the graphic interfaces and ressources needed to interact with the user, and the application opens its "starting screen".<br>
From that moment on, the activation of other dormant modules of FERMAT will follow according user&#8217;s demand ( depending on users activity).</p>

This platform "wakes up" when receiving a call from the application (Android) or executable program (others OS) that is written in OS&#8217;s specific programming language.
Then, FERMAT CORE (written in JAVA - therefore its <strong>code base portability</strong>) initializes the rest of the platforms and its corresponding <strong>plugins</strong> .
Its modules provide the <em>class</em> definitions that are the representation of the entire multi-platform system.<br>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we have at least one <strong>Niche Reference Wallet</strong> (e.g.<strong>Bitcoin Reference Wallet</strong>), we can realize that in the <strong>front-end</strong> there are two disctint tasks taking place: on one hand, there exist a <strong>navigation structure</strong> (available menus, tabs, buttons, etc) that provides the means by which the user operates the wallet, an on the other hand, there exists a set of <strong>resources</strong> (multimedia files, images, etc) used for the visualization of each element of the wallet.
At the <strong>back-end</strong> , where the really action is occuring, we have a lot of modules acting to provide the necessary functions, like:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>sending and receiving the cryptocurrency</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>If someone having the required programmer&#8217;s skills wants to build a Wallet, he would necessary have to build every and each one of the modules needed for the wallet to run begin to write the code from zero. However, if you remember that FERMAT is an open system allowing third part developers and actors in general to form part, developers of new wallet can use any of the available <strong>reference niche wallet</strong> to reutilize the COMPLETE back-end ( all the programming code stuff!), and concentrate his endeavour only to the *front-end*making his job a lot easier and allowing all his creativity to be channeled in a better and more attractive result for the end user.

<h4 id="_inside_the_wallet_factory">5.1.1. Inside the Wallet Factory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step to create a wallet is to join FERMAT an get an identification as DEVELOPER.
Then, the new registered <strong>developer</strong> installs the WaFa-module (Wallet Factory) and logs-in.<br>
After entering, he choses a <strong>reference niche wallet</strong> to import, gives his walletś project a new name and saves it as a new WFP-file (WALLET FACTORY PROJECT FILE).<br>
Once he has his <strong>own project</strong> he will re-define the <strong>navigation structure</strong> (functionalities of the wallet) and then he will assign which <strong>wallet ressources</strong> he will choose to give his wallet an unique appearance.<br>
The last step is to runthe project and test how it works until he is satisfied with the result.<br>
To give birth the new wallet into the world, he will have to <strong>publish</strong> it using FERMAT WALLET PUBLISHER.</p>

This module also has the responsability of notifying the release of new updates for each version or upgrades to new versions of the existing wallets.</p>

The Wallet Store functions in a similar way of known app-stores, and it serves to show the user the wallet that may be attractive to him. Itis a <strong>distributed catalog</strong> of wallets.<br>
When one new wallet is chosen, the Wallet Store notifies the Wa-Ma (Wallet Manager) app to make it available to the user.<br>
Internally, the Wa-St module keeps the identity of the wallet, of its developer, and of the ressources used by it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wallet prompts the user to provide a <strong>password</strong> ( or <strong>passphrase</strong> ) on first run. Then it generates a pair of privat key/public Key for him, and derived from it, a valid <em>bitcoin address</em> and the QR-Code image associated with it.
When the user decides to send a payment, he enteres the amount and chooses the destination among the addresses stored in the contact&#8217;s list, the wallet software creates a transaction with the valid format of a bitcoin transaction, it signes the transaction with the wallet&#8217;s user unique digital signature (derived from his privat/public key), and sends it to the bitcoin network to be propagated among the active nodes.,s and when it is confirmed by others, it becomes part of the blockchain. When the transaction is confirmed by a mining node, it is written inside a transaction block of a new bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s block.<br>
At this stage, the BTC amoun was really "spent" i.e. transfered from the wallet&#8217;s user to the destination user.
The Bi-Wa will then be able to show its up-dated balance, and also the succesful transaction in the wallet&#8217;s transaction&#8217;s log.</p>

<h3 id="_code_examples">Code Examples</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The examples are illustrated in Python, C++, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or Mac OS X. All code snippets are available in the <a href="https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook">GitHub repository</a> in the <em>code</em> subdirectory of the main repo. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the code snippets can be replicated on most operating systems with a minimal installation of compilers and interpreters for the corresponding languages. Where necessary, we provide basic installation instructions and step-by-step examples of the output of those instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the code snippets and code output have been reformatted for print. In all such cases, the lines have been split by a backslash (\) character, followed by a newline character. When transcribing the examples, remove those two characters and join the lines again and you should see identical results as shown in the example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the code snippets use real values and calculations where possible, so that you can build from example to example and see the same results in any code you write to calculate the same values. For example, the private keys and corresponding public keys and addresses are all real. The sample transactions, blocks, and blockchain references have all been introduced in the actual bitcoin blockchain and are part of the public ledger, so you can review them on any bitcoin system.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">address</dt>
<dd>
<p>A bitcoin address looks like <code>1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV</code>. It consists of a string of letters and numbers starting with a "1" (number one). Just like you ask others to send an email to your email address, you would ask others to send you bitcoin to your bitcoin address.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">bitcoin</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the currency unit (the coin), the network, and the software.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">block</dt>
<dd>
<p>A grouping of transactions, marked with a timestamp, and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network consensus.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">blockchain</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of validated blocks, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">confirmations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. As soon as <em>another</em> block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confirmations, and so on. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">fees</dt>
<dd>
<p>The sender of a transaction often includes a fee to the network for processing the requested transaction.  Most transactions require a minimum fee of 0.5 mBTC.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">miner</dt>
<dd>
<p>A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">network</dt>
<dd>
<p>A peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every bitcoin node on the network.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Proof-Of-Work</dt>
<dd>
<p>A piece of data that requires significant computation to find. In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the difficulty target. </p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">reward</dt>
<dd>
<p>An amount included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the Proof-Of-Work solution. It is currently 25BTC per block.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">secret key (aka private key)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The secret number that unlocks bitcoins sent to the corresponding address.  A secret key looks like <code>5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>In simple terms, a transfer of bitcoins from one address to another. More precisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">wallet</dt>
<dd>
<p>Software that holds all your bitcoin addresses and secret keys. Use it to send, receive, and store your bitcoin.</p>

<h3 id="_once_upon_a_time_in_greece">Once upon a time in Greece..</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pythagoras had to pay his first student to convince him to study with him. He gave him three oboli (about a penny) per lesson until one day he said there was no more money. The student replied that he preferred to pay, provided that they continued with the lessons. The rumor ran through the Greek islands and so the Pythagorean School, also known as the Secret Brotherhood, a philosophical / religious monastic order counting 300 members, was formed. By then counting and calculating had been widely practiced by the Babylonians and Egyptians but the Pythagoreans went far beyond that. <strong>“All is Number”</strong> was their motto attesting to their conviction that numbers were the key to life itself. Pythagoras strongly believed that relationships between numbers could reveal, through logical demonstration, all the secrets of the universe, hence he started producing his theorems. The Brotherhood walked briskly with his theorems but did nothing to share the secrets of the universe arousing the ire of the people who one day set the school on fire.
Despite the desperate attempt of his students to save him Pythagoras himself died in the fire. The Brotherhood was dispersed until Alexander the Great founded Alexandria and in order to attract scholars to the new city he took the advice of his general, Ptolemy: “Gather the great books; great minds will follow.”
Hence the Library of Alexandria was established with the overall aim of collecting every book ever written. Each traveler had their books confiscated upon arrival to Alexandria. They would be handed over to scribes, who made a copy for the owner and sent the original to the library. The extensive collection comprising 500,000 volumes made Alexandria the intellectual capital of the ancient world and as Ptolemy had envisaged attracted the most famous scholars of the era.
Euclid was put in charge of the math section and by inventing the “reductio ad absurdum” that is the proof by contradiction he took the findings of Pythagoras one step further. Anything that would defy logic seemed abominable to Pythagoras and as such was dismissed.
Though the Pythagoreans had discovered irrational numbers (pi, or the square root of two) such was their fear of the “unutterable” numbers that their study was immediately forbidden and the disciple who came up with the concept of the “square root of two” was executed. Euclid announced to everyone that Pythagoras was abominable and advocated that irrational numbers would open a new door for mathematics and as such encouraged them to think about them without fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>===The first peer to peer network
Julius Caesar’s attack on Alexandria marked the demise of the Royal Library as it was burnt down in a devastating fire and the invaluable collection of scrolls was reduced to ashes. In an attempt to win Cleopatra’s heart Mark Antony bought the entire Library of Pergamos, which had been second only to the Great Library of Alexandria, and presented the 200,000 volumes to Cleopatra. By having done so, Alexandria continued to boast the greatest library in the world until its eradication by Islamic troops entering the city in the 7th century under the leadership of Caliph Omar. The Caliph ordered the destruction of all books on account of either opposing the Koran, which was considered to be heresy or for being superfluous. For years the water of the public baths of Alexandria was heated using those books to feed the fire. Mathematicians learned their lesson: in order not to disappear the Brotherhood expanded to everywhere without having a center but its members continued keeping in close contact with each other. This marked the beginning of the mathematical tradition of sharing every doubt, every finding and every gossip with the near and distant colleagues (they tell feedback). Should we call it the first and oldest peer to peer network?
Soon two separate branches of mathematics i.e., applied mathematics and number theory began to evolve dividing the mathematician community. Those more intrigued by the practical application formed working groups whereas those merely interested in numbers preferred to work alone. Newton accused the representatives of the latter branch of being vulgar ego jugglers, who had been wasting their time teasing each other with riddles which lacked concrete utility. An ardent supporter of that school was a judge in Toulouse called Pierre de Fermat, whose greatest pleasure in life was to play with numbers and then to send little notes about his findings to Descartes and Pascal. When it came to mental calculations such were his skills that Fermat had no inclination to spend time putting them in writing claiming that it would halt his reasoning and hated being asked about the intermediate steps. He was solution -rather than demonstration- oriented and found it appealing to be compared to big names.
One day he took the famous theorem of Pythagoras (the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs) and concluded that the equation has no integer solutions for powers greater than two.
“It is impossible for a cube to be the sum of two cubes, a fourth power to be the sum of two fourth powers, or in general for any number that is a power greater than the second to be the sum of two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.” he scribbled in the margin of his copy of the ancient Greek text Arithmetica by Diophantus thereby creating one of the most notable puzzles in mathematics driving many mathematicians to insanity until proven three hundred and fifty years later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>===The prize
In the first two hundred and fifty years it was a puzzle merely for young mathematicians who immediately abandoned it as soon as they had arrived to the conclusion, previously drawn by Gauss, that solving this puzzle would not contribute to the progress of mathematics. It was toward the end of the nineteenth century that a German amateur mathematician Paul Wolfskehl struck by love sickness was on the verge of committing suicide.
While waiting for the stroke of midnight to shoot himself in the head he passed the time reading about the latest progress in solving Fermat’s Last Theorem. Touched by a flash of inspiration he began working on the solution and so lost he became in it that morning found him in his library. Even though his approach failed at last the intricate beauty of number theory once again awakened his desire for life.
The young Wolfskehl turned out to have more talent for business than for pure numbers and over the years he had become a millionaire, however, he never forgot that night. In order to repay the debt he rewrote his will bequeathing 100,000 Marks to the first person who could solve the puzzle. Following his death in 1906 the Wolfskehl Prize was announced fueling public desire to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, which greatly contributed to the progress of number theory.
The solution
A mountain of failed attempts to win the prize had been accumulating in the basement of the University of Göttingen, 621 proofs, all flawed had been sent just within the first year of Wolfskehl’s death. By 1993 no serious mathematician would engage in trying to solve the longstanding riddle of Fermat’s Last Theorem, only fans, mostly inmates and lunatics, persisted.
Then in 1993 it was at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, the heart of the world of mathematics (a building created with the intention of bringing together the greatest mathematicians for a week each year, a building with not a single private corner, with offices having no doors and with blackboards even in bathrooms and in the elevator) that a freckled Englishman announced to his illustrious peers that working fully alone for ten years without the aid of a computer he had solved Fermat’s Theorem.
Returning from his classes at Princeton University he would sat alone at the table, sometimes even twelve hours, a piece of paper lying in front of him every so often scribbling a formula like the old Fermat did. However, unlike Fermat he diligently noted down not only each and every formula but their endless development also.
Mathematicians say their specialty is an archipelago of small certainties scattered in a sea of ignorance. The real advances in mathematics are made when the bridges connecting these islands are built. In his dissertation Andrew Wiles established so many bridges that the entire history of mathematics could be reconstructed based on that, and that is exactly what the Hindu Simon Singh did by writing his beautiful book entitled Fermat’s Last Theorem.
All representatives of number theory are enumerated in that book, however, the most remarkable of all is an unnamed colleague, who when facing Wiles as he was triumphantly leaving the stage addressed him with undisguised obfuscation: <strong>“And now that you have taken away the problem, what are you going to give us in return?”.</strong></p>
