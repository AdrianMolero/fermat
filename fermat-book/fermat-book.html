<h3 id="_what_is_fermat">What is Fermat?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is a P2P Multi-Digital-Wallet system that handles both <em>crypto currencies</em> and <em>digital assets</em> and it allows non-developers to create their own digital wallets reusing or combining other wallets or wallet components built into the system as plugins. It is like Wordpress for digital wallets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To achieve this a first layer of <em>reference wallets</em> are developed to address different use cases, one per wallet.<br>
A second layer of <em>niche wallets</em> combine reference wallets functionalities and add their own touch.<br>
This enables a third layer of <strong><em>branded wallets</em></strong> that can be generated just by changing the look and feel and navigation structure of niche wallets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is the allow any company big or small, brand or institution to have their own digital wallet with <strong>any</strong> subset of the whole functionality built for the entire user community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_community">Fermat Community</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is an Open Source project and there is an active community of developers, designers and academics contributing to it. The project&#8217;s maintainer community is bitDubai, a joint venture of some of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project started on August 2014 and the early first version of its core was written from January to May 2015 by a handful of people. From there many more developers joined in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today Fermat is a vibrant community spanning several countries and disciplines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_vision">The Vision</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fermat Community believe that the next decade will witness <strong>crypto currencies</strong> going mainstream and governments issuing digital currency as well. They expect <strong>paper money</strong> is going to <em>disappear</em> within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for <strong>digital wallets</strong> will inevitably emerge. In order to meet this demand thousands of diferent wallets should be available, different not only in terms of the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing crypto currencies while others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their appearance and how they feel to the user, as well as differencies in their functionalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fermat Community is contributing to that future with a System to build and run any kind of digital wallets easily by any developer or even non-developers.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Empower every person in the world with the appropriate tools to save and move their money in a digital format in an efficient, secure an private way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give back the sovereignty over each one&#8217;s own resources, respecting the freedom of choice about which currency to use and how to administrate it, regardless of the place they live or where they were born.</p>

<h3 id="_fermat_s_mission">Fermat&#8217;s Mission</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To get cryptocurrencies mass adopted as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build the best possible integrated system able to handle the finances of not only all the human world population but also of companies and machines in the context of the IoT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_challenge">The challenge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of Fermat addressed the answers to the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can the perception of complexity on crypto currencies by ordinary people be isolated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the collective intelligence of the developer community be used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the entire current infrastructure already in place be reused?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can legacy financial institutions be integrated in a way they feel comfortable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes be integrated in a clever way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can non-developers be allowed to create digital wallets without programming anything at all?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answers to each of these questions are addressed within Fermat.</p>

<h2 id="_chapter_1_fermat_master_plan">Chapter 1: Fermat Master Plan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Master Plan, Fermat has it&#8217;s own vision of how a collaborative project should be carried out. The main concept is to define a large master plan far into the future, and start building it phase by phase adjusting the target when needed. It is designed in this way to absorb the efforts of thousands of contributors over the years into a unified architectural vision.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the pioneer step of Sakamoto who gave rise to <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and its revolutionary blockchain technology, in the last years, there has been a lot of fin tech investment money given to a myriad of startup initiating in this industry. This fostered the next evolutionary step, <strong>"cryptocurrency 2.0"</strong> but it has still not reached the level of adoption expected. There seems to exist an unbalance between the considerable investment of funds and effort needed to master this technology and the results they are bringing up. What is more, isolated projects trying to build something useful starting form zero point have it difficult to obtain the necessary support and the persistent endurance needed to succeed&#8230;<br>
Precisely aknowledging this weak points in the industry, and choosing <strong>collaboration</strong> within a <strong>master plan</strong> as starting point, it is how the Fermat Community believes to succeed in solving the challenges set in their mission and purpose by building a complete new framework that solves the problem in an efficient, inclusive and attractive way.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_phase_i_foundations">Phase I: Foundations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal is to have a framework for developing financial applications in a trust-less environment. What are the services that had to be granted at the lower levels to enable this?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat as a system is built on several overlapping architectural paradigms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a higher level, it is a Peer to Peer system with asymetric nodes, meaning that each node even having all the code base, it specializes itself according to the profile of the end user or the way it was configured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside each node Fermat features a Multi-OS architecture meaning that the lowest level OS-dependent components are wrapped in a way that can be easily replaced when running on a different OS without affecting the rest of the components consuming services from them. The upmost components, the ones facing the end user (GUI) are also OS-dependent. Everything in between is <strong>not</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time it features a plugins architecture inserted into a multi-layered structure. These layers are ocasionally grouped into <strong>Superlayers</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These Plugins are subdivided into a hierarchy of <strong>Platforms</strong>. Those <strong>Platforms</strong> shares a common set of layers, and each one adds <strong>Actors</strong> and <strong>Products</strong> to the overall functionallity of the Fermat system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside each Plugin, you might find a specialized structure and in many cases a database or files belonging to that plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a system level, Fermat uses speciallized crawlers to collect or sometimes inject information into nodes in order to recreate a system level conciousness prepeared to resist attacks or other relevant issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_p2p_architecture">p2p architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is a decentralized system, so it needs to stablish a connection between every actor and every device using it, and this is done by creating a P2P-NETWORK between them, based on the services provided by <em>Fermat P2P Network and Communication Superlayer</em>.<br>
There are certain <strong>Layers</strong> that provide services at a system-wide scale (see <a href="#superlayers">FERMAT Operating Systems Superlayer</a>), but other layers are constraint within one <strong>platform</strong> (see <a href="#platformDescription">[platformDescription]</a>) and the layer&#8217;s modules interact to render the platform the set of specific functionalities it was built for.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_multi_os_architecture">multi OS architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is <strong>code-base portable</strong>, meaning that the components are written in code that runs in different operating systems.
So, through <em>Fermat Operating Systems API Superlayer</em>, the components that are specific to a given Operating System connect to the rest of Fermat that is OS independent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="multilayer">multilayer architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat needs to be adaptable, to provide highly component reutilisation, and to offer a scalability that match the complexity of the service that is running on it. Therefore the components are set in <strong>layers</strong> stacking one over the other. Each layer groups components that provide a similar functionality, eg. communications layer is designed to provide a way to connect one device to another building a "communications channel" using different available tecnologies ( cloud servers, wifi, NFT, etc), and in performing this task, it let other components from other layers do their specific task consumming services of this communication layer in a transparent way, without any concern on how the communication is actually being stablished.<br>
There are certain <strong>Layers</strong> that provide services at a system-wide scale (see <strong>superlayers</strong>), but other layers are defined within one <strong>platform</strong> and its modules offer and consume services to allow the platform offer its set of specific functionalities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plug_ins_architecture">plug-ins architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong> have an outstanding feature: as long as theier INTERFACE (i.e. the shape of the interconnection) is known and public, the plug-in can interact with others, consuming and offering services, INDEPENDENTLY of its inner structure and how it is built. As long as they conserve this INTERFACE, they can safely evolve to more efficient functioning WITHOUT altering a single service that has been built upon it !
Inside Fermat, each plug-in is given certain specific responsability within the whole, it lives in a certain layer, and it is allowed to consume services of components on <em>lower layers</em> and to provide services to components of <em>upper layers</em>. Plug-ins participate in high level processes and they are programmed in a way to live in an uncontrolled environment (end user devices) and to co-exist with untrusted third party plug-ins as well.
Through its plug-ins, Fermat is able to connect and reuse most of the infrastructure deployed by the industry.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_platform_architecture">platform architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>platform</strong> consists of a group of components living in different <strong>layers</strong> interconnected to offer a specific set of services for a discovered niche. For example, if we address to cryptocurrency users, we will need a <em>crytocurrency wallet</em> for each cryptocurrency available running on <em>Fermat Crypto Currency Platform</em>. This wallet would operate on the selected cryptonetwork by means of a connection to it provided by the <em>Block Chain Platform</em>, and will interact with the user by means of an <strong>desktop</strong> living in the OS specific layers.</p>

<h3 id="_identities">2.1. Identities</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of main concept&#8217;s inside Fermat&#8217;s design is the distinction of different <em>levels of identities</em> depending on the realm where this <em>identities</em> are valid. These creates a hierarchical structure of <em>identities</em> and the <em>credentials</em> associated with it.
The <strong>real person</strong> who wants to use Fermat, has to install the software in at least one <strong>device</strong> and then let it run.
At this stage, the real person gets an initial identity a <strong>device user</strong>, which is automatically given by Fermat and is transparent to him (needs not to worry about it and/or decide anything about it). This is valid for all the functions that happend INSIDE the device, and it contains certain information about himself/herself that is known to the device operating system, and which is stored in the device&#8217;s memory/hard drive.<br>
Then, to start using Fermat, he/she is prompted by the software to choose a <strong>master identity</strong> within Fermat. That means to choose an <em>username</em> (or _ alias_) and a <em>password</em> to be recognized as a <strong>Fermat system user</strong>, and has certain <em>profile</em> associated with it.
Then, the <strong>real person</strong> turned into a <strong>user</strong> of Fermat, chooses to run any of Fermat&#8217;s products, and this takes him to play certain role within a specific Fermat Platform available, what turns him/she into an <strong>actor</strong> of the platform. As such, he/she must define an <em>actor identity</em>  within THIS platform, which is INDEPENDENT to any other created in other platforms, although it is related to the Fermat system-wide <strong>master identity</strong>.<br>
This <strong>actor</strong> has the possibility to define a set of multiple <em>wallet identities</em> to operate within each wallet, defining a <em>profile</em> for each one, choosing the profile concepts to include (name, picture, occupation, etc) and the content of them, having total control of which information he shares with the world.<br>
For the external world, each <em>wallet identity</em> appears to be a "different person" and there are NO RELATIONS between them. However, for the <strong>Fermat User</strong> owning his <strong>master identity</strong>, all his <strong>actor identities</strong> and <strong>wallet identities</strong> are interconnected.</p>

<h3 id="_actors">2.2. Actors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cryptocurrencies live in a public and distributed ledger, the <strong>blockchain</strong>, in a decentralized p2p network (spread in every network node).<br>
They are held and stored by their owners in specific applications called <strong>wallets</strong> living in a certain device which has access to the corresponding cryptonetwork.<br>
<strong>Wallets</strong> store the owner&#8217;s <em>privat key</em> and the corresponding <em>public key</em> to unlock the cryptocurrency amount of a given <strong>transaction</strong>.<br>
For a <strong>transaction</strong> to take place, a <strong>crypto address</strong> is needed to identify both the sender of the value as well as the receiver.<br>
<strong>Crypto addresses</strong> are generated by the wallet derived from the <em>privat/public key</em> pair of the wallet&#8217;s owner.<br>
Although <strong>wallets</strong> are similar in relationship to their basic functionalities, the <em>natural segmentation of the world population</em> and the specific demand of every segment requires to be taken into account when designing <strong>wallets</strong>.<br>
Fermat defines different system <strong>actors</strong> to identify the specific needs and level of abstraction required to each actor, and consequently being able to design Fermat&#8217;s products with the appropiated orientation.</p>

<p>The application written for the chosen Operating System of your device (eg.

Android is a <strong>special case</strong> because of some programming restrictions that only allow initialization from components written in android&#8217;s language.

<p>Fermat CORE initializes every single platform of the system and instantiate every single plug-in giving the "start" signal by means of an usual "service"interface (each plugin knows what "start"means in each case).

These Wallets are created in a way that they generate a <strong>master privat key</strong> and taking this key as a <strong>parent branch</strong> of a derivation tree, a complete set of <strong>children</strong> keys might be derived from it in a hierarchical deterministic manner.

There are some keys that are the most ephimere because the are <em>renewed</em> each time the process changes its <strong>status</strong>.

<p>For certain basic communications demand, a cloud server is a reasonable good option.

It is esential for offering network services that the <strong>device user</strong> as well as the <strong>intraActor</strong> modules are running and <strong>logged in</strong> the cloud server, which will therefore inform their status as "<strong>online</strong>". Then, when a <em>local</em> <strong>network service</strong> needs to contact its <em>counterpart</em> it "logs in"the cloud server and requires a <strong>communication channel</strong> with the specific <strong>intraActor</strong> in a specific <strong>device</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="layersExplanation">6. FERMAT layers explanation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong><em>multilayer architecture</em></strong> reveals useful when grouping the plugins according to their common functionalities, which on one hand gives a certain order and structure to the system and lets identify common challenges to solve when writing code, but on the other hand, the conceptual strength of using <em>layers</em> stimulate the creation of future plugins that reveal to be necessary when decomposing the big task in smaller steps to solve and implement. What&#8217;s more, plugins originally conceived to serve a certain function, afterwards appear to be reusable for new developments.<br>
We have already explored in the previous sections how FERMAT is initialized, the main role of the <strong>Core Platform</strong> to deploy the whole system structure, and the first available services provided by the system-wide <strong><em>superlayers</em></strong> .<br>
Now, let us explore the next <strong><em>layers</em></strong> following on top, which are similar in every following <strong><em>FERMAT platforms</em></strong>.<br>
<strong>Layers</strong> are built with a considerable atomicity in its components (i.e. each component deals with a very specific and contrained kind of events) what really renders the whole FERMAT system with a strong, structured and solid foundation and at the same time a large flexibility and adaptability for further development and evolution.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_platform_services_layer_em">6.1. <em>Platform Services layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The modules in this layer handle the very basic tasks that allow plugins interact safely in and uncontrolled environment, taking care of a careful transmission of responsability from one component to another and specially the management of exceptions and track of all system&#8217;s <strong>events</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_network_service_layer_em">6.2. <em>Network Service layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each time that a certain system function must perform any operation <strong>outside</strong> the device where FERMAT is running, a <em>network service</em> is required to follow the execution in other devices until is completed.<br>
Network services' modules need to have a <strong>communication channel</strong> stablished and maintained between the parties involved, what is done by the <strong>P2P networks and communication superlayer</strong> ( see the explanation at the previous section <a href="#communicationLayer"><em>Communication Layer</em></a> )<br>
Each <strong>network service module</strong> running on a <em>local device</em> stablishes communication EXCLUSIVELY to its <em>counterpart</em> running in the <em>remote device</em>.<br>
The module handles a table of request and responses to communicate with the counterpart and so perform the required task.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_actor_network_service_layer_em">6.3. <em>Actor Network Service layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have already introduced the concept of system <strong>actors</strong> to guide the functionalities to match the specific needs of FERMATs users, in this layer live the modules that provide <strong>network services</strong> specifically to interconnect the <strong>actors</strong> intervining in the operations held by a specific platform within FERMAT, by "mapping" the <strong>actor identity</strong> with the <strong>user identity</strong> on which it depends.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_identity_layer_em">6.4. <em>Identity layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This layer holds the plugins to manage all the necessary information about the actors <strong>identity</strong> within FERMAT. This <strong>identity</strong> is a pair of privat/public key that act like a credential to access to certain functionalities in FERMAT specific for the user, for example, to access to his own <strong>wallets</strong>.<br>
To interact with third parties, another "credential" is used to represent the <strong>user</strong>, that is what in FERMAT we call <strong>actor identity</strong>, and it is defined in the <a href="#actorLayer"><em>Actor layer</em></a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_world_layer_em">6.5. <em>World layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this layer the components consult certain specific information from the world "outside"of FERMAT, usually checking indexes on webpages, or gathering any kind of information offered in the web, to make this available to FERMATs plugins to consume the collected data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_wallet_layer_em">6.6. <em>Wallet layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Wallets</strong> are essentially programs that manage money, in this case, money whose value is stored in a <strong>blockchain ledger</strong>.<br>
<strong>Wallets</strong> in FERMAT require several services provided by different plugins in different <em>layers</em>, and there are plugins related to the <strong>storage of value</strong> (those belonging to the <em>Block Chain Superlayer</em>, the <strong>vaults</strong>) and others that do the registration of the <strong>transaction information (metadata)</strong> and the necesary functions to display the result in the way required by the <strong>wallet</strong>.<br>
The modules in this layer do all the <strong>accountancy operations</strong> related to the wallets.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transaction is dependent on the <em>atomicity</em> of the changes of status in the operations involved, so each <em>transaction plugin</em> should aknowledge wether the operation was succesfully ACCEPTED or at the contrary, it was REFUSED.
Each plugin deals with a certain <em>transaction type</em> defined by different criteria, mostly of the time, according to the <strong>actors</strong> involved and the <strong>direction</strong> (incoming / outgoing).<br>
In FERMAT the <strong>transport of value</strong> goes on a parallel path to the <strong>transport of information (metadata)</strong> of the transaction, so both transports are managed by the <em>transaction plugins</em>.</p>

<p>Once we have at least one <strong>Niche Reference Wallet</strong> (e.g.<strong>Bitcoin Reference Wallet</strong>), we can realize that in the <strong>front-end</strong> there are two disctint tasks taking place: on one hand, there exist a <strong>navigation structure</strong> (available menus, tabs, buttons, etc) that provides the means by which the user operates the wallet, an on the other hand, there exists a set of <strong>resources</strong> (multimedia files, images, etc) used for the visualization of each element of the wallet.
At the <strong>back-end</strong> , where the really action is occuring, we have a lot of modules acting to provide the necessary functions, like:<br></p>

<p>If someone having the required programmer&#8217;s skills wants to build a Wallet, he would necessary have to build every and each one of the modules needed for the wallet to run begin to write the code from zero. However, if you remember that FERMAT is an open system allowing third part developers and actors in general to form part, developers of new wallet can use any of the available <strong>reference niche wallet</strong> to reutilize the COMPLETE back-end ( all the programming code stuff!), and concentrate his endeavour only to the *front-end*making his job a lot easier and allowing all his creativity to be channeled in a better and more attractive result for the end user.

Then, the new registered <strong>developer</strong> installs the WaFa-module (Wallet Factory) and logs-in.<br>
After entering, he choses a <strong>reference niche wallet</strong> to import, gives his walletś project a new name and saves it as a new WFP-file (WALLET FACTORY PROJECT FILE).<br>
Once he has his <strong>own project</strong> he will re-define the <strong>navigation structure</strong> (functionalities of the wallet) and then he will assign which <strong>wallet ressources</strong> he will choose to give his wallet an unique appearance.<br>
The last step is to runthe project and test how it works until he is satisfied with the result.<br>
To give birth the new wallet into the world, he will have to <strong>publish</strong> it using FERMAT WALLET PUBLISHER.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This platform provides all the interconnectivity necessary to interact with existent cryptonetworks (Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc) and also to develop plug-ins for new cryptocurrencies invented in the future.<br>
It contains the specific modules needed to run a Crypto Currency Wallet on FERMAT, whose functions depend on consuming the services provided by other modules in lower layers.
For a <strong>niche wallet</strong> to run, we need to count on modules offering:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 user identification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 device identification</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>4 cyptoaddress management (addressbook)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 network services ( to allow processing of events occurring outside the running device ) ( <strong>information transport</strong> )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 world services ( to allow access to information provided from services living in the web like exchange rates,&#8230;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 transaction layer ( to allow the broadcasting of transaction created in a wallet)</p>

<h3 id="_bitcoin_wallet">11.1. Bitcoin Wallet</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This wallet is one of FERMAT&#8217;s basic building block to allow interaction with the
most popular cryptonetwork: Bitcoin.<br>
FERMAT&#8217;s Bitcoin&#8217;s Niche <strong>Reference Wallet</strong>  is a <em>basic wallet</em> in terms of its functionalities, even simpler as other popular BTC wallets on the market. This is so  to maximize its ulterior reutilisation.<br>
This wallet provides the minimum necessary functionalities to perform a succesful transaction of Bitcoins: (+)</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>to make a payment in BTC ( send value to a BTC Wallet owner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to receive payments in BTC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to show the transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to show the balance of the wallet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to show a basic contacts list ( username and cryptoaddress related to each contact)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wallet prompts the user to provide a <strong>password</strong> ( or <strong>passphrase</strong> ) on first run. Then it generates a pair of privat key/public Key for him, and derived from it, a valid <em>bitcoin address</em> and the QR-Code image associated with it.
When the user decides to send a payment, he enteres the amount and chooses the destination among the addresses stored in the contact&#8217;s list, the wallet software creates a transaction with the valid format of a bitcoin transaction, it signes the transaction with the wallet&#8217;s user unique digital signature (derived from his privat/public key), and sends it to the bitcoin network to be propagated among the active nodes.,s and when it is confirmed by others, it becomes part of the blockchain. When the transaction is confirmed by a mining node, it is written inside a transaction block of a new bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s block.<br>
At this stage, the BTC amoun was really "spent" i.e. transfered from the wallet&#8217;s user to the destination user.
The Bi-Wa will then be able to show its up-dated balance, and also the succesful transaction in the wallet&#8217;s transaction&#8217;s log.</p>

<h3 id="_code_examples">Code Examples</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The examples are illustrated in Python, C++, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or Mac OS X. All code snippets are available in the <a href="https://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook">GitHub repository</a> in the <em>code</em> subdirectory of the main repo. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the code snippets can be replicated on most operating systems with a minimal installation of compilers and interpreters for the corresponding languages. Where necessary, we provide basic installation instructions and step-by-step examples of the output of those instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the code snippets and code output have been reformatted for print. In all such cases, the lines have been split by a backslash (\) character, followed by a newline character. When transcribing the examples, remove those two characters and join the lines again and you should see identical results as shown in the example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the code snippets use real values and calculations where possible, so that you can build from example to example and see the same results in any code you write to calculate the same values. For example, the private keys and corresponding public keys and addresses are all real. The sample transactions, blocks, and blockchain references have all been introduced in the actual bitcoin blockchain and are part of the public ledger, so you can review them on any bitcoin system.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">address</dt>
<dd>
<p>A bitcoin address looks like <code>1DSrfJdB2AnWaFNgSbv3MZC2m74996JafV</code>. It consists of a string of letters and numbers starting with a "1" (number one). Just like you ask others to send an email to your email address, you would ask others to send you bitcoin to your bitcoin address.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">bitcoin</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the currency unit (the coin), the network, and the software.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">block</dt>
<dd>
<p>A grouping of transactions, marked with a timestamp, and a fingerprint of the previous block. The block header is hashed to produce a proof of work, thereby validating the transactions. Valid blocks are added to the main blockchain by network consensus.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">blockchain</dt>
<dd>
<p>A list of validated blocks, each linking to its predecessor all the way to the genesis block.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">confirmations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once a transaction is included in a block, it has one confirmation. As soon as <em>another</em> block is mined on the same blockchain, the transaction has two confirmations, and so on. Six or more confirmations is considered sufficient proof that a transaction cannot be reversed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">fees</dt>
<dd>
<p>The sender of a transaction often includes a fee to the network for processing the requested transaction.  Most transactions require a minimum fee of 0.5 mBTC.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">miner</dt>
<dd>
<p>A network node that finds valid proof of work for new blocks, by repeated hashing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">network</dt>
<dd>
<p>A peer-to-peer network that propagates transactions and blocks to every bitcoin node on the network.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Proof-Of-Work</dt>
<dd>
<p>A piece of data that requires significant computation to find. In bitcoin, miners must find a numeric solution to the SHA256 algorithm that meets a network-wide target, the difficulty target. </p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">reward</dt>
<dd>
<p>An amount included in each new block as a reward by the network to the miner who found the Proof-Of-Work solution. It is currently 25BTC per block.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">secret key (aka private key)</dt>
<dd>
<p>The secret number that unlocks bitcoins sent to the corresponding address.  A secret key looks like <code>5J76sF8L5jTtzE96r66Sf8cka9y44wdpJjMwCxR3tzLh3ibVPxh</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>In simple terms, a transfer of bitcoins from one address to another. More precisely, a transaction is a signed data structure expressing a transfer of value. Transactions are transmitted over the bitcoin network, collected by miners, and included into blocks, made permanent on the blockchain.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">wallet</dt>
<dd>
<p>Software that holds all your bitcoin addresses and secret keys. Use it to send, receive, and store your bitcoin.</p>

<h3 id="_the_story">The Story</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pythagoras had to pay his first student to convince him to study with him. He gave him three oboli (about a penny) per lesson until one day he said there was no more money. The student replied that he preferred to pay, provided that they continued with the lessons. The rumor ran through the Greek islands and so the Pythagorean School, also known as the Secret Brotherhood, a philosophical / religious monastic order counting 300 members, was formed. By then counting and calculating had been widely practiced by the Babylonians and Egyptians but the Pythagoreans went far beyond that. “All is Number” was their motto attesting to their conviction that numbers were the key to life itself. Pythagoras strongly believed that relationships between numbers could reveal, through logical demonstration, all the secrets of the universe, hence he started producing his theorems. The Brotherhood walked briskly with his theorems but did nothing to share the secrets of the universe arousing the ire of the people who one day set the school on fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the desperate attempt of his students to save him Pythagoras himself died in the fire. The Brotherhood was dispersed until Alexander the Great founded Alexandria and in order to attract scholars to the new city he took the advice of his general, Ptolemy: “Gather the great books; great minds will follow.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the Library of Alexandria was established with the overall aim of collecting every book ever written. Each traveler had their books confiscated upon arrival to Alexandria. They would be handed over to scribes, who made a copy for the owner and sent the original to the library. The extensive collection comprising 500,000 volumes made Alexandria the intellectual capital of the ancient world and as Ptolemy had envisaged attracted the most famous scholars of the era.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Euclid was put in charge of the math section and by inventing the “reductio ad absurdum” that is the proof by contradiction he took the findings of Pythagoras one step further. Anything that would defy logic seemed abominable to Pythagoras and as such was dismissed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though the Pythagoreans had discovered irrational numbers (pi, or the square root of two) such was their fear of the “unutterable” numbers that their study was immediately forbidden and the disciple who came up with the concept of the “square root of two” was executed. Euclid announced to everyone that Pythagoras was abominable and advocated that irrational numbers would open a new door for mathematics and as such encouraged them to think about them without fear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_first_peer_to_peer_network">The First Peer to Peer Network</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julius Caesar’s attack on Alexandria marked the demise of the Royal Library as it was burnt down in a devastating fire and the invaluable collection of scrolls was reduced to ashes. In an attempt to win Cleopatra’s heart Mark Antony bought the entire Library of Pergamos, which had been second only to the Great Library of Alexandria, and presented the 200,000 volumes to Cleopatra. By having done so, Alexandria continued to boast the greatest library in the world until its eradication by Islamic troops entering the city in the 7th century under the leadership of Caliph Omar. The Caliph ordered the destruction of all books on account of either opposing the Koran, which was considered to be heresy or for being superfluous. For years the water of the public baths of Alexandria was heated using those books to feed the fire. Mathematicians learned their lesson: in order not to disappear the Brotherhood expanded to everywhere without having a center but its members continued keeping in close contact with each other. This marked the beginning of the mathematical tradition of sharing every doubt, every finding and every gossip with the near and distant colleagues (they tell feedback). Should we call it the first and oldest peer to peer network?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Soon two separate branches of mathematics i.e., applied mathematics and number theory began to evolve dividing the mathematician community. Those more intrigued by the practical application formed working groups whereas those merely interested in numbers preferred to work alone. Newton accused the representatives of the latter branch of being vulgar ego jugglers, who had been wasting their time teasing each other with riddles which lacked concrete utility. An ardent supporter of that school was a judge in Toulouse called Pierre de Fermat, whose greatest pleasure in life was to play with numbers and then to send little notes about his findings to Descartes and Pascal. When it came to mental calculations such were his skills that Fermat had no inclination to spend time putting them in writing claiming that it would halt his reasoning and hated being asked about the intermediate steps. He was solution -rather than demonstration- oriented and found it appealing to be compared to big names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One day he took the famous theorem of Pythagoras (the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs) and concluded that the equation has no integer solutions for powers greater than two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“It is impossible for a cube to be the sum of two cubes, a fourth power to be the sum of two fourth powers, or in general for any number that is a power greater than the second to be the sum of two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.” he scribbled in the margin of his copy of the ancient Greek text Arithmetica by Diophantus thereby creating one of the most notable puzzles in mathematics driving many mathematicians to insanity until proven three hundred and fifty years later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_prize">The Prize</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first two hundred and fifty years it was a puzzle merely for young mathematicians who immediately abandoned it as soon as they had arrived to the conclusion, previously drawn by Gauss, that solving this puzzle would not contribute to the progress of mathematics. It was toward the end of the nineteenth century that a German amateur mathematician Paul Wolfskehl struck by love sickness was on the verge of committing suicide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While waiting for the stroke of midnight to shoot himself in the head he passed the time reading about the latest progress in solving Fermat’s Last Theorem. Touched by a flash of inspiration he began working on the solution and so lost he became in it that morning found him in his library. Even though his approach failed at last the intricate beauty of number theory once again awakened his desire for life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The young Wolfskehl turned out to have more talent for business than for pure numbers and over the years he had become a millionaire, however, he never forgot that night. In order to repay the debt he rewrote his will bequeathing 100,000 Marks to the first person who could solve the puzzle. Following his death in 1906 the Wolfskehl Prize was announced fueling public desire to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, which greatly contributed to the progress of number theory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_solution">The Solution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mountain of failed attempts to win the prize had been accumulating in the basement of the University of Göttingen, 621 proofs, all flawed had been sent just within the first year of Wolfskehl’s death. By 1993 no serious mathematician would engage in trying to solve the longstanding riddle of Fermat’s Last Theorem, only fans, mostly inmates and lunatics, persisted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then in 1993 it was at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, the heart of the world of mathematics (a building created with the intention of bringing together the greatest mathematicians for a week each year, a building with not a single private corner, with offices having no doors and with blackboards even in bathrooms and in the elevator) that a freckled Englishman announced to his illustrious peers that working fully alone for ten years without the aid of a computer he had solved Fermat’s Theorem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning from his classes at Princeton University he would sat alone at the table, sometimes even twelve hours, a piece of paper lying in front of him every so often scribbling a formula like the old Fermat did. However, unlike Fermat he diligently noted down not only each and every formula but their endless development also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mathematicians say their specialty is an archipelago of small certainties scattered in a sea of ignorance. The real advances in mathematics are made when the bridges connecting these islands are built. In his dissertation Andrew Wiles established so many bridges that the entire history of mathematics could be reconstructed based on that, and that is exactly what the Hindu Simon Singh did by writing his beautiful book entitled Fermat’s Last Theorem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All representatives of number theory are enumerated in that book, however, the most remarkable of all is an unnamed colleague, who when facing Wiles as he was triumphantly leaving the stage addressed him with undisguised obfuscation: “And now that you have taken away the problem, what are you going to give us in return?”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_new_problem">The New Problem</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The secret of Fermat’s Last Theorem had been deciphered at last, however, even as of today the world is abundant in puzzles, which despite the tremendous advances in technology, are still waiting to be solved. All my adult life I seem to have been attracted to problems the complexity of which would deter even the most enthusiastic experts of the field. Inspired by the difficulty of the task I have always managed to rise to the challenge and sparing no time and energy succeeded in unraveling the mystery surrounding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After having designed mission critical systems for banks for more than a decade, I found myself in the United Arab Emirates establishing a techno-artistic startup called Nomad Inception boasting a technology which besides having enabled the automated creation of non repetitive Islamic geometric patterns on a scale never seen before also paved the way for new original non repetitive patterns for the first time in five hundred years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being Argentinean I have absolutely no relation to the Arabic culture, however, my fascination with the amazing intricacy and sophistication of Islamic geometric patterns helped me grasp the secrets of a traditional art form mastered by a handful of artisans only. Solving a thousand-year-old historical puzzle and thereby potentially contributing to the preservation of our cultural heritage is a vastly rewarding experience worth all the effort invested in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was in Dubai, where I was setting up my company, that I first learned about bitcoin and having spotted the excellent opportunity my new mission conceived. This era has witnessed the digitalization of music and images. By solving the “problem of double spending” i.e., preventing a digital item to be sent to multiple people more than once, the last obstacle to the digitalization of money was eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was in 2008 that crypto-currencies were first introduced, however, while the CD player and the digital camera have already conquered the world by enabling the wide-spread use of the inventions which called them to life, the technology equivalent to these designed to facilitate the mass conversion of users of paper money to users of digital money is yet to be created. Creation of such a technology is the new problem to solve.  The problem is as complex as it can be, as 6 years have passed and some hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital has been poured into start-ups working in this space since the solution for the double spending problem was found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We suspect the solution involves finding the islands not yet discovered and building bridges to connect them both with each other and with the entire current archipelago.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_divine_sign">Divine Sign</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I delved into studying the problem with newfound enthusiasm, however, my commitments at Nomad Inception prevented me from devoting all my attention to finding the solution until a business meeting changed my life forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am anything but superstitious, however, it goes without saying that the question a potential business partner asked me upon receipt of my business card, on which the word “inception” in Arabic appeared as company logo, could only be interpreted as a divine sign compelling me to leave Nomad Inception without further delay and turn all my attention to find the solution for this modern day Fermat’s problem. You may wonder what the life-changing question was…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Have you been aware that the word ‘inception’ in Arabic used as your logo would read ‘bitcoin’ just by adding one dot to it?”</p>

<h4 id="_what_s_behind_money">What&#8217;s behind money?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our daily live we have accepted money as something present in almost every activity of human endeavour, and most of us use it without reflecting on its origin or its deeper meaning. Making it simple, money is an agreed mean of exchanging value. By its universal adoption it allows a flow of products and services between the different actors in a producer-consumer chain ( or better, in a "web" of commercial interactions) and following this, an exchange of the value associated with each step, rewarding each actor with a portion of the entire value, what we call "profit".
During the early ages trading was made directly exchanging certain goods for other goods, then as trading was growing at scale, the necessity of unification of mass and measures lead to the rising of money representing in some way the value of what was being exchange and a relative consensus over it. Later on, with the rising of the different nations which created a certain unification under certain name, language and goverment and rules to be applied to a determined territory and its inhabitants, this nations extended their souveranity also to the issue of a national currency and the printing of "official" paper money. At the begginning the amount of paper money was guaranteed by a national reserve on gold, but most of goverment abandoned the <strong>gold standard</strong> after the 1930 world crisis, and after 1971 the US goverment severed definitely the link between US Dollar to gold. This means, that the current money we use only depends on the "trust" we deposit on the goverment that rules its emission and this "legal curse" is enforced by law. There is NOT ANY OTHER intrinsec propierty on paper money to ensure its value than this!! When talking about corruption in some of our political and financial institutions, we can easily perceive how often this trust has been abused. This kind of money enforced by law which value is not linked to any specific asset has been called <strong>fiat money</strong>.</p>

<p>When Bitcoin solved the issues that prevented other digital currencies to become a viable digital money ( "authenticity" (of the issuing and ownership) and the "double-spend" problem) it opened a whole new world in financial systems and economy, where cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user&#8217;s claim to value. So, this new kind of currency that is entirely virtual and that is implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient based on crytographic signatures is what we call <strong>cryptocurrency</strong></p>

<td class="content">
The undeniable achievement of Bitcoin&#8217;s electronic signature protocol based on <strong>crytography</strong> is the creation of a distributed public ledger of peer-to-peer electronic transactions that is transparent and at the same time preserves the anonimity and the security needed to become a safe way of transporting <strong>value</strong>, based on <strong>consensus agreement</strong>. This technology opens the door to a new paradigma in economics, computer science, financial operations, and world-wide commerce.<br>
Sakamoto&#8217;s invention makes possible to unveil the world of financial transactions, to get rid of the necessity of <strong>trust</strong> into a third party institution or central goverments, to make money a secure thing, and transactions transparent and effortless. It returns to the money&#8217;s owner the absolute control over his richnes.<br>
The cryptocurrency scheme encourages us to adopt a radical new point of view on money and the concept of value itself and its transport, so radical, that it will take us  time and effort to really grasp it, because it leads to the unconditionally honoring and empowering of each individual.

Taking Bitcoin as "the" paradigmatic model of every cryptocurrency, we need to have in mind that for Bitcoin to exist following is needed:<br>
* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)<br>
* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)<br>
* A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining)<br>
* A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script)<br>
