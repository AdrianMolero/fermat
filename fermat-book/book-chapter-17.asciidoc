== Fermat Crypto Broker Platform
In this platform the actors involved are the *cryptobroker* and his customers (*cryptocustomers*). A *cryptobroker* is a person or small organization whose business logic is to buy and sell cryptocurrency for fiat money in his local market, obtaining his profits from the difference in the buy/sell price. We distinguish also two usual levels of *cryptobrokers*, those acting as *cryptobrokers wholesalers* and those who deal with final users/customers.   

=== New components

[horizontal]
Fiat Index :: to check the exchange rate of fiat currencies.
