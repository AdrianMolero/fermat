A cooperative ("coop") or co-operative ("co-op") is an autonomous association of people who voluntarily cooperate for
their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit.[1] Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and
businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services (a consumer cooperative) or by the people who
work there (a worker cooperative) or by the people who live there (a housing cooperative), hybrids such as worker
cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or credit unions, multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that
bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs, and second and third tier cooperatives whose
members are other cooperatives.

The International Co-operative Alliance was the first international association formed by the movement. It includes
the World Council of Credit Unions. A second organization was formed later in Germany, the International Raiffeisen
Union. In the United States, the National Cooperative Business Association (NCBA) serves as the sector's oldest
national membership association. It is dedicated to ensuring that cooperative businesses have the same opportunities as
other businesses operating in the country and that consumers have access to cooperatives in the marketplace. A U.S.
National Cooperative Bank was formed in the 1970s. By 2004, a new association focused on worker co-ops was founded, the
United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.
