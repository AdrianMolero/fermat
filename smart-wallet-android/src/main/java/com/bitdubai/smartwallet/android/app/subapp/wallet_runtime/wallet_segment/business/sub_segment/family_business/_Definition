A family business is a commercial organization in which decision-making is influenced by multiple generations of a
family—related by blood or marriage—who are closely identified with the firm through leadership or ownership.
Owner-manager entrepreneurial firms are not considered to be family businesses because they lack the multigenerational
dimension and family influence that create the unique dynamics and relationships of family businesses.
