A private foundation is a legal entity set up by an individual, a family or a group of individuals, for a purpose such
as philanthropy or an object legal in the economic operation. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest
private foundation in the U.S. with over $38 billion in assets.[1] However, most private foundations are much smaller.
Approximately two-thirds of the more than 84,000 foundations which file with the IRS, in 2008, have less than $1
million in assets, and 93% have less than $10 million in assets.[1] In aggregate, private foundations in the U.S.
control over $628 billion in assets[1] and made more than $44 billion in charitable contributions in 2007.

Unlike a charitable foundation, a private foundation does not generally solicit funds from the public. And a private
foundation does not have the legal requirements and reporting responsibilities of a registered, non-profit or
charitable foundation.

Not all foundations engage in philanthropy: some private foundations are often used for estate planning purposes.
