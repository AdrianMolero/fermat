/**
 * In computer science, transaction processing is information processing that is divided into individual, indivisible
 * operations, called transactions. Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it can never be only
 * partially complete.
 *
 * For example, when you purchase a book from an online bookstore, you exchange money (in the form of credit) for a
 * book. If your credit is good, a series of related operations ensures that you get the book and the bookstore gets
 * your money. However, if a single operation in the series fails during the exchange, the entire exchange fails.
 * You do not get the book and the bookstore does not get your money. The technology responsible for making the
 * exchange balanced and predictable is called transaction processing. Transactions ensure that data-oriented resources
 * are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transactional unit complete successfully. By combining
 * a set of related operations into a unit that either completely succeeds or completely fails, you can simplify error
 * recovery and make your application more reliable.
