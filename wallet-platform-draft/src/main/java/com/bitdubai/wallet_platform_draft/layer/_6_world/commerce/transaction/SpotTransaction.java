/**
 * Spot transactions are financial transactions that often occur with foreign exchange purchases. The terms of this
 * type of transaction call for immediate payment for the currency, usually at a specified rate and in the currency
 * preferred by the seller. In some cases, the terms of a spot transaction may allow the buyer to pay for the purchase
 * within a specified period of time, usually less than forty-eight hours after the deal is struck.
 *
 * While common in currency trading deals, the concept of the spot transaction is also used in other types of purchase
 * situations. When a buyer pays immediately for any type of goods or services that are also delivered at once, that
 * can be said to be a form of spot transaction. From this perspective, the purchase of any type of goods and services
 * where the buyer pays in cash, and renders the full price to the seller at the time of the purchase, can be
 * classified as a spot transaction.
