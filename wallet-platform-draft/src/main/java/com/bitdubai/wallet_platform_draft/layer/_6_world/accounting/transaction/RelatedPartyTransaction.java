/**
 * A related party transaction is a business-related transaction conducted between two parties that have a relationship
 * with each other. This relationship gives one party the transaction control or influence over the other. Such
 * transactions are legal, but they can create conflicts of interest and there are certain circumstances where they
 * will not be allowed. Companies that are publicly traded are required to disclose related party transactions on their
 * financial statements.
 *
 * For companies with a legal requirement to disclose, a related party transaction can occur between a company and a
 * major shareholder, officer, director, or family member of any of the previous. Special relationships are enjoyed
 * between companies and people in all of these classes. Companies usually assemble panels to make decisions about
 * proposed related party transactions to determine whether or not a transaction is legal and justifiable.
