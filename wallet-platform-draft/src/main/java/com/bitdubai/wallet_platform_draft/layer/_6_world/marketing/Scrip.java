/**
 * Scrip (sometimes called chit) is a term for any substitute for legal tender and is often a form of credit. Scrips
 * were created as company payment of employees under the truck system and also as a means of local commerce in times
 * where regular currency is unavailable, such as remote coal towns, military bases, ships on long voyages, or
 * occupied countries in war time. Besides company scrip, other forms of scrip include land scrip, vouchers, token
 * coins such as subway tokens, IOUs, arcade tokens and tickets, and points on some websites.
 *
 * Scrips have gained historical importance and become a subject of study in numismatics and exonumia due to their
 * wide variety and recurring use. Scrip behaves similarly to a currency, and as such can be used to study monetary
 * economics.
