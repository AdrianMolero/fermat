/**
 * In marketing, a coupon is a ticket or document that can be exchanged for a financial discount or rebate when
 * purchasing a product.
 *
 * Customarily, coupons are issued by manufacturers of consumer packaged goods or by retailers, to be used in retail
 * stores as a part of sales promotions. They are often widely distributed through mail, coupon envelopes, magazines,
 * newspapers, the Internet (social media, email newsletter), directly from the retailer, and mobile devices such as
 * cell phones. Since only price conscious consumers are likely to spend the time to claim the savings, coupons
 * function as a form of price discrimination, enabling retailers to offer a lower price only to those consumers who
 * would otherwise go elsewhere. In addition, coupons can also be targeted selectively to regional markets in which
 * price competition is great.
