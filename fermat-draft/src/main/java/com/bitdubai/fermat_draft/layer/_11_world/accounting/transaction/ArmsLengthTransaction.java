/**
 * An arm’s length transaction involves the buying and selling of goods, services, properties, or stocks between two
 * parties that are completely separate from one another. Generally speaking, an arm’s length transaction is the most
 * common of all types of transactions. Here are some examples of qualifications that must be met in order for the
 * activity to be defined as an arm’s length transaction.
 *
 * Arm’s length transactions are generally thought to only take place between parties that have no kind of familial or
 * business connection to one another. For example, purchasing goods from a company owned by a relative, even if both
 * entities are not affiliated parties, would not be considered a true arm’s length transaction. In like manner,
 * purchasing goods or services from a company that is owned by the same parent organization is often thought to not
 * qualify as an arm’s length transaction, even if the two companies operate independently.
 *
 * The main purpose of the arm’s length transaction is to ensure there are no hints of a conflict of interest that
 * would give one or both companies an undue advantage in the market. This means that the type of discounts or special
 * offers that are employed will be the same kinds of offers that would be extended to any potential customer. Because
 * the idea of discounts between related parties does not come into play with an arm’s length transaction, neither the
 * buyer nor the seller has to deal with any suspicion of anything unethical in the business arrangement.
